This changelog exists to track the changes in NerfHack: https://github.com/elunna/NerfHack.


## QUALITY OF LIFE FEATURES

* Chaotics do not get alignment penalties for angering, attacking, or killing peacefuls (xnh)

* Stop occupations when the hero is caught in a poison gas cloud
* Allow lighting only 1 candle in a stack (GnollHack).

### Streamlined Identification Features
A general design philosophy of NerfHack is to automatically identify items that are unambiguous from various effects. If a quick wiki lookup is all that is needed (ie: sink ring identification) let's save the player from opening up a browser.

* All roles start out knowing potions of water, blank scrolls, and scrolls of identify (one exception is cave dwellers, who don't know scrolls of identify)
* When dropping a container on an altar, the BUC status of all contained items is revealed (NetHack4)
* Your primary wielded weapon is auto-identified after killing enough monsters with it (Evil)
* Auto-identify rings of increase damage and accuracy with enough experience killing monsters.
* When you are XP10+ and have expert skill in a weapon type, you can wield weapons of that type to auto-id the enchantment (only for non-projectile weapons)
* Auto-ID potions of acid when water explosions result from dipping (xnh)
* Auto-ID potions of acid when a lichen corpse is dipped into one
* Auto-ID potions of sickness when they coat a weapon in poison
* Auto-ID potions of sickness and fruit juice when dipping a unihorn in sickness
* Auto-ID potions of see invisible or fruit juice by process of elimination when quaffed.
* Auto-ID potions of restore ability when quaffed
* Auto-ID potions of booze when quaffed
* Auto-ID amethyst, fruit juice, and booze when dipping amethyst into booze (Fourk)
* Auto-ID some potions when inhaling their vapors (xnh)
* Auto-ID scrolls of scare monster when they crumble from being picked up (Un)
* Auto-ID scrolls of confuse monster when read
* Auto-ID scrolls of enchant armor when they erodeproof armor or make dragon scaled armor
* Auto-ID scrolls of food detection if they have an obvious effect
* Auto-ID scrolls of remove curse when read
* Auto-ID rings dropped into a sink (Un)
* Auto-ID rings of regeneration upon wearing
* Auto-ID +0 rings of protection (if MC is increased)
* Auto-ID wands of cancellation after they destroy a bag of holding (Un)
* Auto-ID most wands when engraving (xnh)
* Automatically use a process of elimination for auto-identifying wands when available (Un)
* Auto-id flint stones yielded from (a)pplying rocks to each-other
* Auto-ID most musical instruments upon use (Un)
* Auto-ID magic lamps and oil lamps when #rub is used (Un)
* Auto-ID dunce caps when one is first put on (Un)
* Auto-ID jumping boots when they are worn (Un/Ace)
* Auto-ID water walking boots when they waterwalk (xnh)
* Auto-ID kicking boots when you #kick when them
* Auto-ID BUC of products from BUC identified tinning kit or horn of plenty (UnNetHack++)
* Auto-ID BUC of wands when they backfire
* Auto-id bags of holding when items are added or removed
* Blessed stethoscopes can identify eggs (Evil/Spork)
* Make rustproof/erodeproof/fixed known by default (Dyna)
* **Items that are 'lost'** from the players inventory are longer un-identified.

  * Farlook any monster (press '//'), then press ':' to access the pokedex entry
  * You can also search for a monster or item: press '/' then '?', then type the name of the thing you want information on.
  * For item details, open your inventory and press the letter of the item for info.
* Object lookup also works for artifacts (HackEM)
* Peaceful monsters are underlined [TTY and curses] (xnh)
* Magic cancellation (MC) value is shown on the bottom line (Evil)
* Skill caps and percentage towards next level is available in #enhance
* Show available skill slots in #enhance menu (Dyna)
* Add inventory weight/carrycap and n/52 items display
* /> or < can be used to autotravel to stairs (autostairtravel option)

* All position prompts may be aborted
* Show warning level 0 for very weak monsters (Dyna)
* More descriptive combat messages have been added to enhance hits and misses (xnh)

* Changed the symbol for **sinks** back to #
* The hero's color reflects their race (SLASH'EM)
* Suggest donation amount (relative to XP level) when #chatting to priests
* Use NERFHACKOPTIONS instead of NETHACKOPTIONS so it does't clash with NetHack.
* Added a "Rabid" status for when the player is rabid

* Don't livelog events in explore mode

#### Farlook enhancements
* We are able to see more monster conditions on farlook (Evil/Splice/xnh)
  * You can ascertain monsters that are berserking, rabid, and/or spell-beings which appear as "sparkling".
* Farlook also shows amulets and rings monsters are wearing
* We are able to see what weapon a monster is wielding from farlook (Evil)
* We are able to see roughly how much armor a monster is wearing on farlook (Evil)

* Show timeouts for sick, rabid, withering, and other afflictions in the wizmode enlightenment menu


## ITEM CHANGES


* Levels of erosion on an item can affect its price (Evil).
* orcish equipment usually generates rusty and/or corroded
* dwarvish items sometimes spawn as fixed.
* Towels cannot be worn over the eyes - blindfolds now must be relied upon for blinding.
* Wet towels provide 100% protection from poison gas when worn.
* Scrolls, rings, and wands have a variety of new appearances (Un/Slice)
* Having really low intelligence (under 6 INT) prevents you from reading most things (Evil).


### Price Identification Nerf
This change destroys price identification and conforms most potions, scrolls, wands, and rings to the same price (SLEX).

* All rings cost $200
* All potions cost $200
* All wands cost $200
* All scrolls cost $200

Exceptions:
* cursed or blessed potions of water still cost $100
* Potions of blood, milk, and healing cost $100
* Scrolls of identify and knowledge cost $100
* Cards of zapping still cost $50. These are usually only present for cartomancers.

### Item Erosion and Destruction
* Objects can be completely destroyed via rusting/rotting/corroding (Evil)
* Almost all items are erodible/destroyable (Evil) - amulets, rings, wands, and tools are now eligible for erosion and destruction.
* Silver items can also corrode (xnh)
* The iron ball and chain cannot be destroyed from rusting (Evil)
* Poison gas clouds can rot organic armor
* Extrinsic poison resistance protects items from rotting in poison gas
* Monsters can wear down and destroy any armor with the destroy armor spell except crystal plate mail (Evil)
* Scrolls can burn up when hitting hot ground in Gehennom. (3.7 introduced potions being shattered when dropping on hot ground - this just takes it a step further.)
* Getting hit by potions of acid can corrode armor. Monster acid attacks and spit also corrode armor.
* Passive acid attacks corrodes armor more often.
* Thrown potions of acid can corrode items or armor when they hit a monster or the player.
* Water damage may disintegrate scrolls; may occur when dipping (Dyna)
* Disintegration rays can vaporize boulders
* Items can be erodeproofed via confused enchant weapon scrolls or by dipping into potions of reflection.
* Item erosion can be repaired by dipping into a potion of restore ability (xnh)

#### Fragile items are more vulnerable
* Beams of force bolt and striking can break fragile items in inventory.
* Knockback attacks can also shatter fragile items in inventories.
* Fragile items can be fixed to avoid destruction (note that although mirrors can be tempered, they are still subject to shattering when reflecting rays)
* Wands of striking and rings of shock resistance are immune from impact damage.
* Rings of shock resistance protect fragile items in your inventory from physical damage when worn.

#### Bones files trimming
* When bones files are left, a random selection of items are subject to shuddering or polymorph. Do not depend on the dumplog for accurate results!
* Items that grant wishes will be converted to non-magical equivalents.
* Magic markers are converted to athames.
* Quest artifacts cannot be left in bones, they revert to ordinary objects.

### Anti-magical items resist being enchanted (from SpliceHack)
* If an item grants magic resistance, it will resist scrolls of enchant weapon and enchant armor.
* The resistance is not absolute.
* Gray dragon scales can always be converted to dragon scaled armor.

**For enchant weapon:**

| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| +0                  | 0%                |

### Weapon changes
#### Higher max weapon enchantment
* Weapons can be enchanted much higher, with a soft limit of +11.
* This means that the new "+5" is "+11", and +13 is easily attainable by reading a blessed scroll of enchant weapon with a +11 weapon.
* To compensate, weapon enchantment gives variable to-hit bonus instead of flat bonus. This means that instead of a +7 weapon granting +7 to-hit, it grants a random to-hit bonus from +1 to +7, inclusive.
* Random weapons have a small chance to generate with very high enchantment.

* Lords, princes, and uniques will also appear with much higher enchantment on their weapons.
* Beware, over-enchanted weapons that vaporize now explode.
* Your wisdom is abused whenever you over-enchant and destroy them.


#### Misc weapon changes
* Swapping weapons take 0 turns (dnh)
* A welded cursed quarterstaff doesn't block spellcasting (xnh)
* Cursed launchers always have a chance of misfiring.
* Cursed projectiles can hit yourself in the leg (Evil).
* Crysknives are never auto-quivered
* Any slashing or piercing weapons can now be poisoned (SLASHEM)
* Launchers don't count as weapons for the 'hit with a wielded weapon' conduct
* Reduced probability of long swords generating (K-Mod)
* Increased probability of boomerangs
* Increased weight of war hammers to 120.
* Reduced weight of morning star to 50.
* Reduced weight of bullwhips to 7 aum
* Increased weight of shuriken to 2 aum each.
* Wielded polearms grant an AC bonus depending on their weight (for every 30aum, they grant -1AC)
* **Spears** at expert skill can skewer through enemies, allowing you to hit the enemy directly behind the target. Peacefuls are prevented from being hit unless the spear is cursed. We also won't auto-skewer the spot unless it is visible or spottable via ESP. Skewering doesn't trigger most passive attacks unless it's a passive electrifying attack and you attack with a metal spear. Most of the time you won't get a skewer unless the monster is below 20% of it's health, otherwise if it's a kebabable monster or a solid or blobby monster, you'll always be able to skewer.
* **Tridents** at basic can also skewer monsters.
* **Spetums** can skewer up to 3 monsters when used in melee whilst riding a steed
* **Ranseurs** can disarm monsters or the player when pounded or used in melee whilst riding a steed.
* **Bardiches (long poleaxes)** have a 1 in 100 chance of beheading monsters (or the player)
* Wielding and unwielding **curved swords** takes 0 turns.
* **Morning stars and flails** can stun monsters (or the player) on critical hits. Player must be skilled or better.
* Special weapon effects (like rogue backstab, flail stunning, and samurai katana weapon smashing) have been enabled when two-weaponing.
* **Crossbows** no longer grant multishot, instead their damage output is multiplied by your skill (dnh)
* **Boomerangs** will can pass through enemies on hit.
* **Polearms** can be used to trigger traps (Fourk).
* **Polearms and lances** can be pounded when blind (as long as you can sense the target)
* **Daggers and knives** have a small chance to mulch. If non-cursed, the probability is 1 in 100. If cursed, they go through the same checks as other mulchable projectiles.
* **Bows and crossbows** are two-handed.
* Ported the modified version of L's Bullwhip Patch (xnh).
* **All *launchers* can contribute to missile projectile damage **(adapted from SpliceHack); the damage is calculated as d(x/3), where x is the current enchantment of the launcher.
* **war hammers** have been changed from a one-handed weapon into a competitive two-handed weapon (xnh). They now deal 2d6 vs small monsters and 2d8 vs large

#### Slings
* Projectiles receive a strength bonus when using slings (xnh). However, this bonus is 3/4'th what is normally granted.
* Gem class projectiles do minimal damage vs thick-skinned monsters
* Launching gem class projectiles from slings has the potential to instakill H

### Armor changes
* reduced weight of most armors by 50 aum (K-Mod)

#### New armor type: bracers

TODO: Fill in
   New armor type: bracers, which also occupy the shield slot (from EvilHack).

    This implementation mostly follows EvilHack's, just adapted to 3.7 and with new types of bracers.

    Bracers weigh 15 (half as much as a small shield). They allow the use of weapons while worn and don't impede spellcasting or martial arts. However, to balance them out so that shields are not rendered obsolete, they grant 0AC. They still benefit from shield skill, but the rate is only 1AC per skill. So basic = 1AC, skilled = 2AC, etc.

Elves and centaurs can spawn with bracers.

#### New dragon armor system: DSM replaced by scaled armor

Ported from xNetHack's implementation. The following text was revised from xNetHack
commit 00fec37778:

This proposal, referred to as the "dtsund-DSM" system, developed by dtsund and jonadab, introduces a significant change to how dragon scales are used in the game. Instead of dragon scale mail being its own type of armor, players can now incorporate dragon scales into existing armors—such as leather armor, chain mail, and others. These "scaled" armors provide the same extrinsic benefits as traditional dragon scale mail whilst retaining their original properties.

**Motivation for the Change**
The primary reason for replacing dragon scale mail with this system is to enhance armor strategy. Dragon scale mail was overwhelmingly optimal, rendering other armor choices irrelevant. It was simultaneously:
- **Lightweight**,
- **Higher in base AC** than any other armor,
- **Naturally erodeproof**,
- **Unrestrictive for spellcasting**,
- **Easily obtainable** before the Castle or Quest, often as an early wish, and
- **A source of powerful extrinsics** (e.g., reflection, magic resistance).

Once dragon scale mail became available, there was little incentive to consider other armors. With this new system, players must weigh the pros and cons of different base armors, making armor strategy relevant beyond defeating the first few dragons.

**Benefits of the New System**
This approach aligns with the philosophy of prioritizing found items over wished ones. Previously, even excellent armors like mithril chain mail would only serve as placeholders until dragon scale mail became available. Now, players can find dragon scales, integrate them into their chosen armor, and continue using it throughout the game.

**Key Details**
- Dragon scales provide +3 AC when used as a cloak and add +3 AC to any scaled armor.
- Scaled armor is **not automatically erodeproof**, maintaining the risk of erosion into the midgame. Players can still erodeproof their armor or attach scales to naturally erodeproof materials.
- Following the system used in Nethack Fourk, if a player polymorphs and merges with their scaled armor, it will return after unpolymorphing. This is an intentional buff, ensuring that players do not lose enchantments or scales.
- **Potions of phasing** can also be used to graft dragon scales onto armor.

**Other dragon scale notes:**
* Dragon scales now weigh 80.
* Shopkeepers price dragon-scaled armor at a high value (xnh).
* When wishing for dragon scales, any specified enchantment is nullified to +0 (xnh)
* Dragon scales do not provide secondary intrinsics, they must be enchanted into scale-mail for the secondary effect to kick in.

| Dragon     | Scales confer      | Scaled armor confers       |

* Potions can sometimes generate diluted.
* Shopkeepers only offer 1/2 price for diluted potions.
* Diluted healing potions heal less and grant less max-HP (EvilHack).
* Vampire blood doesn't provide HP gains if diluted.

#### Gem Alchemy
* Ported from UnNetHack, originally from SLASH'EM.
* This allows you to dip a gem into a potion of acid, to alchemize a potion with a specific appearance.
* This adds some serious value to potions of acid and gems.
* Gem alchemy recipes can be viewed in the object lookup entry for "potion of acid".
* Other potions and gems should display their respective recipes.
* Gems auto-id after successful gem alchemy.
* Gem alchemy results are usually diluted; achieving pure results improves slightly with high Luck.

  * If a directional wand is cursed and the player zaps it, there's a 1 in 8 chance it will backfire, hitting the player instead.
* Wands will never explode when engraved with (SLASHEM)
* Blessed and uncursed wands wrest much more often (EvilHack)
  * blessed wands wrest 1/4 of the time

  * cursed wands still wrest 1/8 of the time
* Wands are used up even if they fail their wresting chance (EvilHack)
* Wand of cancellation extensions
  * Monsters can zap the player with wands of cancellation
  * Being cancelled removes most temporary effects (invisibility, protection, reflection)
* Wands of secret door detection can be broken to detect traps.
* Wand explosions discharge their effects in an explosion (SLASH'EM).
* Monsters zapping cursed wands have double the chance of explosions.
* You must have at least one free hand (that is not welded to a cursed item or shield) to zap a wand.
* Plastic wands can neither be broken (via apply) nor exploded by shock damage. This includes all wands made of plastic material including: "plastic", "pliable", and "green".
* Wands can sometimes generate pre-charged

* Amulets of magical breathing are immune to water damage
* Amulets of unchanging can't be polymorphed (Un)
* Amulets of guarding are now chargable with variable AC protection (positive or negative)
* Reduced the probability for amulets of reflection.
* Amulet of life saving will not work if the player is in nonliving form (EvilHack).
* Cursed amulets of life-saving are ineffective.

#### Eating Jewelery & Accessories
* Eating rings and amulets only confers an intrinsic for a temporary period.
* To compensate for the temporary nature of these intrinsics, the possibility of getting the property is guaranteed.
 * Before, the chance of getting an intrinsic from a ring by eating it was 1 in 3. It is now 100%. The chance for an amulet by eating it was 1 in 5. It has been changed to 100%.

** Summary of revised eating effects:**
 - Eating a ring now grants 750-1500 turns of it's property intrinsically.
 - Eating an amulet now grants 1250-2000 turns of it's property intrinsically.
 - Eating the amulet of reflection now gives intrinsic reflection for 1250-2000 turns. Previously it would not grant anything.

### Tools
* Reduced weight of land mines to 40 aum (xnh)
* Reduced weight of beartraps to 50 aum (xnh)
* Reduced weight of pick-axe to 75 aum (SLASHEM)
* Reduced weight of potions to 10 aum
* Increase the prices of many magical tools
* Raised price of magic marker to 500
* Raised price of magic lamp to 500 (xnh)
* Magic lamps are more rare, wax candles are more common.
* Using eroded unlocking tools also has a chance to break.
* Playing eroded musical instruments can break the instrument or fail to play.
* Applying rusty stethoscope is much less effective.
* Stethoscopes don't work on undead or nonliving monsters.
* Rusty tin openers can break.
* Applying a cursed horn of plenty causes hunger.
* Using a cursed unlocking tool has a chance to break (Evil)
* Credit cards may slip through a lock when cursed or hero is fumbling (xnh).
* Reduce crystal ball paralysis if player has free action (Dyna)
* saddles are now twice as common (FIQ)
* Switch probabilities of bags of holding vs oilskin sacks so BoH are more rare.
* Make beartraps stackable (xnh).
* Tools have the same recharging limits as wands and have a chance to crumble (instead of exploding)

#### Safer bags of holding:
The following safeguards were added to protect players from exploding bags:
* Players cannot put **known** wands of cancellation or magical bags into **identified** bags of holding. Keep in mind, unknown wands and bags are still dangerous and should be handled with care until formally identified (dnh)
* Players are prevented from tipping **known** explosive items into **identified** bags of holding
* Empty wands of cancellation may still be placed inside bags of holding (no risk of blowing up)

DISCLAIMER: Bag of holding explosions are not prevented when confused or hallucinating!

* Another subtle but helpful change: bags are not susceptible to burning up when lava walking. In Vanilla this was never the case, but in some variants bags can sometimes burn up unless foo-proofed.

#### Magic markers
* Appear randomly much less often (1/5'th of the frequency in Vanilla)
* They can still be created from polypiling
* There is a 1 in 4 chance of a magic marker being the Sokoban prize.
* There is also a chance of a magic marker being hidden in the Lost Tomb level.
* Added magic markers to soko1-7 and soko1-8.
* Any role that could start with a magic marker always starts with one.

#### Unicorn horns
* Unicorn horns are now one-handed, dealing d6 vs small/d7 vs large
* Cancelled unicorn horns become degraded, unusable for curing. A unihorn only becomes degraded if it's enchantment is +0, otherwise it is drained of 1 enchantment level. However, a degraded horn still has a 1 in 20 chance of success.
* Unicorn horn drops decrease as the number of unicorns killed increased.
* Since they are much more rare, be more careful when dipping into random potions as potions of acid will dissolve your unihorn!
* Unicorn horns cannot be poisoned (via toilet dipping)

#### Mirrors confer reflection while carried
* This applies to both the player and monsters.
* While carrying a mirror in open inventory, you will benefit from reflection.
* However, whenever a mirror reflects a ray, there is about a 50% chance the mirror will shatter. If you were the originator of the ray, you will be subject to a -2 luck penalty. If monsters cause the breakage, there is no luck effect.
* Artifact mirrors like the Magic Mirror of Merlin are shatterproof and will resist destruction when reflecting any rays.
* Cracked mirrors always shatter when they reflect a ray.
* Medusa's stoning gaze always shatters mirrors that reflect her gaze.
* Beware of nymphs since they regularly carry mirrors...
* Applying a mirror to Medusa starts slow stoning instead of instapetrification.

**Unicorn horns now reduce the timeouts of most afflications instead of outright curing.**
* For troubles that time out (not illness or vomiting), the unihorn has been nerfed so that it only reduces the timeout.
* The amount reduced depends on a few factors:
  * the base fix is 1d3 + 1
  * your skill in unicorn horn (multiplied by 2)
  * the enchantment on your unicorn horn (multiplied by 3)
  * if you are a healer or you hit the luck bonus, double the entire above sum
  * the **luck bonus** goes up with your luck. At 0 luck, there is a 4.2% chance, at 11 there is a 20.4% chance.
  * Add all of the following for the time out reduction roll (or "tRoll").
  * For each afflication, we roll d(tRoll) for the amount reduced.
* Regardless of any of the above, there is always a 1 in 20 chance of completely curing a condition.
* Applying a unihorn can also exercise your unihorn skill.

Historical Note: The success rate change from SLASH'EM was experimented with, but ultimately discarded in favor of the timeout nerf.

### Gems/Stones/Rocks
* Reduced weight of flint stones to 2 aum (xnh/Spork)
* Reduced base cost of flint stones to 1.
* Reduced weight of rocks to 4 aum
* Rocks can be broken (a)pplied to produce flint stones (xnh). When the player breaks rocks, they enter into an occupation which continues until the rocks are used up.
* Flint stones can be struck (applied) against objects made of iron, producing sparks (fire). This can scare certain monsters away who fear fire. (Spork/THEM)
* Boulders deal 1+5d4 damage instead of 1d20.
* Cursed gems count as attacks when thrown at unicorns.
* Significantly lowered the odds of luckstones generating randomly; increased the odds of other gray stones
* Unicorn gems are used up when they yield Luck.

* Potions of reflection are immune to fire and cold damage.
* Cursed potions of reflection aggravate monster (similar to cursed potions of invisibility)
* Cursed potions of phasing removes any intrinsic phasing and resets your stats (like self polymorph)
* Shields of integrity are also immune to erosion.
* (!) fingerless gloves do not protect against petrification

### potions of blood and vampire blood
* Increased the nutrition for blood potions
* reduced nutrition for diluted blood.

### potion of milk
Non-cursed potions of milk reliably cancel out a lot of good and bad effects:
* hallucination
* confusion
* stunning
* blindness
* protection given by spell
* reflection given by potion
* phasing given by potion
* invisiblity
* see invisible
* telepathy
* milk also will un-poly a player or monster back to their original form.

Other effects:
* non-diluted milk heals 1 HP
* Cursed milk is always spoiled and causes nausea without cancelling any effects.
* Blessed milk also increases your max HP by 1.
* Monsters will also drink milk to cure stunning and confusion only - but will have the other effects cancelled as unpolying.
* Dipping a poisoned item into milk unpoisons it.

### playing card deck
* When applied, gives you a poker hand which correlates to your luck.
* If the deck is blessed (or you are a cartomancer), you get a clear indication of your luck
  by using the kicker.
* If uncursed, you get a rough indication of your luck by the hand strength.
* If cursed, the meanings are reversed.
* Can be #tipped and emptied for a stack of razor cards

### scroll of cloning
* Ported from SpliceHack with modifications
* This is a $300 scroll that can clone an item in your inventory or clone yourself if read whilst confused.
* Attempting to clone unique items or items that are too powerful will result in lesser quality results: magic markers, magic lamps, wands of wishing, scrolls of cloning, artifacts, and any invocation items.
* To copy the enchantment on an item, the scroll must be blessed.
* If the scroll is cursed, the resulting item will be cursed.
* All other properties on the item should be copied exactly as is. This enables fun tricks like cloning a +13 fixed crysknife, or that blessed figurine of an Archon you've been holding onto.
* When confused, the scroll clones the player. The resulting clone will have no inventory. A blessed scroll creates a tame clone, an uncursed scroll makes a peaceful clone, and a cursed scroll makes a hostile clone. An interesting side-effect of this is that cloning yourself reduces your current HP by half.
* If confused and the scroll is blessed, you can also clone yourself to create a powerful tame pet if you currently hold a strong polyform (ie: master mind flayer, purple worm, etc)

**Here are the updated features from SpliceHack:**

Unpaid items cloned in shops now become the property of the shopkeeper. Additionally, more item properties are carried over during cloning, including erosion-proofing, container status, and other miscellaneous attributes to ensure that items are genuinely cloned.

Intelligent monsters can also use these scrolls to clone themselves, which helps balance the scroll's power, as many will be consumed by monsters. When monsters read the scrolls, they always read-as-confused, meaning they can only clone themselves. Whilst this approach might seem odd, it simplifies the system by avoiding the complexities of allowing monsters to clone items.

Unique monsters can use these scrolls as well, but the Wizard of Yendor must still follow the Double Trouble routine, ensuring that no more than two Rodneys can oppose you at any time. However, other unique monsters have the potential to clone themselves more than once if the opportunity arises.

### deck of fate
This tarot-based deck is very powerful and was ported from SpliceHack with some major changes. In Splice, you would be prompted for how many cards to draw. This has been changed to be a mandatory draw of 5 cards, eliminating the prompt. After using the deck, it is always destroyed, allowing only one use. Because it is capable of granting wishes, the deck of fate cannot be wished for, cloned, or created from polypiling.

There are 22 different cards in the deck, each having a potentially good or bad effect. About half the cards are "good" and half "bad". There is a nudge factor that occurs if the deck is cursed or blessed.

If cursed, the drawn card value will be lowered by one notch. This means The World is impossible to draw with a cursed deck since it's the highest numbered card at 22. It also doubles the chance of drawing The Tower since that card is number 1.

If blessed, the drawn card value is raised by one notch. This effectively doubles your chances of drawing The World and prevents The Tower from being drawn.

**Before you start drawing cards, your current alignment is set to -1.** Be wary of any artifacts you may wish for because an artifact blast is guaranteed - both because your alignment is negative and because artifact blasts will always occur if possible. Artifact blasts have also been increased, making early arti-wishes much more dangerous.

* Unlike the playing card deck, decks of fate cannot be #tipped for razor cards, making them easy to identify.

### healthstone
* Ported from SLASH'EM with updates
* A blessed healthstone now increases your regeneration rate by 10%.
* An uncursed healthston increases regeneration by 5%.

### whetstone
* Ported from SLASH'EM with updates from HackEM.
* Whetstones no longer can add positive enchantment to a weapon, they can only repair it to +0.

### foulstone
Effects of carrying a foulstone:
* Causes aggravate monster (but without increasing the difficulty of spawned monsters)
* Monsters cannot digest you and you cannot digest monsters carrying one.
* Shopkeepers will not let you into their shops and won't buy it.
* If blessed, has a 1 in 100 chance each turn of emitting a stench that scares monsters for a short while (similar to garlic breath)
* If cursed, has a 1 in 100 chance each turn of emitting a poisonous cloud on your square.
* The effects can stack, so carrying multiple foulstones increases the frequency of the cursed or blessed effects.

Other effects:
* Monsters will never eat this rock and it's inedible if you are polyd into a monster that could eat it.
* Pets will try not to step on one (treated as a cursed item).
* If rubbed on another rock, emits a poisonous cloud.
* Foulstones always generate cursed.
* Cursed foulstones cannot be dropped (like loadstones).
* These always autocurse when dropped.

* Instead, wherever a monster or player would have been insta-killed, a stoning timer is started for 5 turns.
* This applies for every instapetrification effect: touching a footrice corpse, being knocked into a footrice
* Footrice only inflict slow stoning for the player and for monsters

### Dangerous piercers
* All piercers are mindless and can grow up
* Much more AC is required to dodge dropping piercers (previously, -2AC would nullify their drop attacks, now -22AC is required)
* Piercing damage scales with their level (monster level * 6) with a minimum of 4d6 being dealt.
* Piercers and lurkers/trappers always generate hidden if possible.
* Hidden piercers (and other ceiling clingers) can surprise attack you from adjacent squares.

**Piercers can actually pierce hard helmets:** Piercers can penetrate even the toughest helmets, but the level of enchantment on your helmet determines its resistance to piercer damage and destruction:

**Helmet Resistance:**
* Only hard and metal helmets are affected, cloth and leather helms are safe from this specific damage.
* If a piercer strikes a helmet with a negative enchantment, the helmet is instantly destroyed.
* For helmets with positive enchantments, a successful hit reduces the enchantment level by -1. With bad luck, the penalty may range from -1 to -3.
* Glass and Crystal Helmets: Glass helmets (e.g., crystal helms) don’t lose enchantments. Instead, they crack over time, following erosion rules rather than enchantment degradation.
* Enchanting your helmet can be both protective and risky. A higher enchantment level defends against weaker piercers but may still leave you vulnerable to stronger ones.
* Special Case – God Piercers: God piercers deal extremely high damage. Your best defense is achieving an AC of -22 or better, as even the most enchanted helmets provide limited protection against their attacks.

**Enchantment Levels and Piercer Resistance:**
* +1 enchantment: Generally protects against rock piercers.
* +2 enchantment: Generally protects against iron piercers.
* +3 enchantment: Generally protects against glass piercers.
* +4 enchantment: Generally protects against diamond piercers.

### Reviving and Poisonous Zombies
* Zombie corpses may auto-revive similar to trolls (Evil/xnh)
* Cancelled or beheaded zombies/trolls don't revive (Evil)
* Wielding Sunsword prevents zombies corpses from appearing (Evil)
* Playing as a priest reduces the chance of zombie revival by 50% (Dyna)
* All zombies get an additional poisonous bite attack that can drain constitution.
* Sometimes zombies will try to bite the players legs, inflicting wounded legs for a short time.
* Zombies are immune to being scared by any source (xnh)

### Dragon changes
* Dragons have been overhauled to more closely resemble the versions in SLASH'EM and FIQHack.
* An attempt has been made to make each dragon have a special quality or perk.
* Part of the challenge in SLASH'EM was that adult dragons (and therefore dragon scales) were more difficult to come by. Baby dragons are plentiful and can potentially be tamed and grown up into adults, but with the large gap in levels the process is long and difficult. It's possible they might not be guaranteed in Ludios or the Castle anymore either, but the increased frequency means they should show up in Gehennom much more often.
* Dragons are always generated awake and pissed for Knights (from EvilHack).

**Baby dragon changes**
* Most baby dragons are level 4 and difficulty 6 (SLASHEM)
* Their size has been reduced from HUGE to LARGE (eliminates possible knockback on the player)
* Reduced their weight from 1500 to 1000.
* They can generate randomly in the dungeon with a frequency of 1, but not in Gehennom
* Baby dragons get a special 1d6 bite attack instead of a 2d6 physical bite (K-Mod).
* For most dragons, their bite matches their adult breath attack (red = fire bite, blue = shock bite, etc).
* All baby dragons get an additional 1d6 claw attack
* baby dragon alignments match their adult counterparts (Evil)
* baby red dragons can berserk
* baby blue dragons are slightly faster at speed 12
* baby green dragons regenerate, and are slightly higher level and difficulty
* baby yellow dragons get a passive acid attack
* baby gray dragons flank
* baby white dragons are weaker
* baby gray dragons get a disenchanting bite
* baby black dragons get a drain life attack (and level 7 difficulty)

**Adult dragon changes**
* They get a 3d8 bite and 2d4 claw attacks, and are frequency 2.
* Their speed has been increased from 12 to 20, and have a small buff to their claw attacks (FIQ)
* all dragons stalk/follow the player (FIQ)
* red dragons can berserk
* blue dragons are faster (speed 24)
* green dragons regenerate and are slightly higher level
* orange dragons get an engulf digestion attack
* black dragons get a terrifying roar
* yellow dragons get a passive acid splash attack
* white dragons are weaker than other dragons
* gray dragons can flank
* shimmering dragons have displacement and resist stunning

### Unique monster changes

* Ixoth can berserk. AC raised from -1 to -4, stronger claw attacks.

* King Arthur gets a full suite of resistances.
* Give Baalzebub some combat buffs (xnh).

* Dispater drops a deck of fate.

**Medusa**
Inspired by EvilHack, Medusa gets an overall difficulty boost:
* She goes from level 20 to 24
* She gets -8AC (a big buff from 2AC)
* Her weapon attack goes from 2d4 to 4d4
* Instead of a single poisonous bite, she gets two poisonous snake bite attacks.
* Medusa also gets a stoning bite (Evil).
* Medusa gets infravision

**Wizard of Yendor**
* Rodney is bright magenta (Evil)
* Rodney will never steal the quest artifact of the current role (Un)
* Rodney gets a strong weapon and the ability to use it (Evil)

**The riders**
* Each rider gets an additional 100 HP (EvilHack)

**Cthulhu:**
* NerfHack's Cthulhu is a blend of his counterparts in SLASH'EM and UnNetHack with some new enhancements to make him a fearsome component of the endgame:
* Speed of 18 matches SLASH'EM.
* AC was lowered from -15 to -8 to match UnNetHack.
* Cthulhu's inventory os prevented from being shown when probed (Un)
* Cthulhu now has flying and is telepathic
* Cthulhu can displace monsters, pass through iron bars, break boulders and bust down doors to get to you.
* Cthulhu will always track you down and chase you.
* Converted the drain intelligence attack to drain energy instead.
* Cthulhu is placed right in the middle of Moloch's Sanctum as a guardian but does not receive the Amulet of Yendor.
* Important note: Even though Cthulhu is covetous (M3_WANTSAMUL) he will not teleport and instead follow the new movement rules that other covetous demons do.
* Allow Cthulhu to return via wizard harassment if the player is carrying the Amulet of Yendor.

### Flanking behavior
* Ported from SpliceHack, with enhancements
* Monsters with this property have the M2_FLANK tag.
* Any two monsters can flank a player (or another monster) if they sandwich the target. However, monsters with this property ("outflankers") are more tactical and will actively seek opportunities to flank you.
* Monsters gain a large to-hit bonus when flanking
* Flanking now scales with monster level (it used to be a flat +4 AC penalty in SpliceHack):
* Monsters that are natural outflankers get a much higher bonus than other monsters.
* Flanking has been applied to many monsters in NerfHack.

* Using a pet, you can also take advantage of flanking. Simply place yourself and your pet in such a way as to "sandwich" the monster. You (or your pet) will get a flanking bonus on the victim when attacking.

Flanking restrictions:
* You cannot flank if hallucinating, afraid, confused, punished, fumbling, wounded, unaware, stunned, or standing on an Elbereth engraving.
* You must be able to see the monster you want to flank.
* Monsters cannot flank if eating, sleeping, fleeing, confused, stunned, trapped, petrified, sick, diseased, stationary, or hiding.

Certain roles also count as natural flankers and will get higher bonuses than other roles:
  - Knights
  - Monks
  - Rangers
  - Rogues
  - Samurai
  - Valkyries

### Berserking behavior
* Ported from EvilHack, with modifications
* Monsters with this property have the M3_BERSERK tag and can be quite dangerous if you take them for granted
* When berserkers are below 50% of their health, they have a high chance to go into berserk mode
* Monsters can also immediately go berserk if they are woken and angered
* When a monster goes berserk it turns hostile and regains a roll of it's max HP, possibly
  recovering all of its HP.
* Nearby denizens are also woken up when a monster goes berserk (it screams in anger)
* When berserking, monsters totally ignore Elbereth or Scare Monster. If they are usually skittish or trying to keep away, they will instead actively approach
* Berserking monsters also never flee when their HP gets low
* A berserking monster deals double damage rolls when hitting you
* Taming berserking monsters only un-berserks them, it doesn't pacify or tame
* Monsters that can berserk: all dwarves, mordor orcs, uruk-hai, mumaks, zruty, fire giants, frost giants, storm giants, ettin, all ogres, owlbears, sasquatch, and balrog.
* Berserkers get angry when stuck in traps.

### Rabid monsters
This is a brand new mechanic, debuting in NerfHack!

* There is a fairly small probability of a monster spawning rabid, but bats and coyotes always have a 1 in 10 chance of spawning infected.
* Rabid is mostly limited to living mammals. Insects, birds, and lizards cannot contract it.
* For special rooms (zoos, throne rooms, etc), rabid monsters are prevented from spawning.

Effects of the rabid status on monsters:
* Rabid monsters get an additional bite that can cause the player to become rabid. This bite attack is also poisonous (damaging CON), similar to the rabid rat.
* Rabid monsters don't regenerate
* They grudge all non-rabid monsters (that are capable of catching rabies).
* They occasionally move erratically
* They will never flee or become scared and will actively approach.
* Rabid monsters cannot quaff potions.
* Rabid monsters cannot be tamed.
* If a tame pet becomes rabid, it immediately loses its tameness and becomes hostile.
* Rabid monsters grant a little extra XP when killed.
* Rabid humanoids will growl when #chatted with.

Effect of being rabid on the player:
* You cannot regenerate
* You become bloodthirsty in your attacks (similar to wielding Stormbringer).
* You occasionally move erratically - 1 in 10 moves is confused.
* When the player is infected a timer starts from 100 + d(CON*2) turns.
  * At 40 turns, you develop a fear of water and cannot quaff potions.
  * At 10 turns, you become confused.
  * At 0 turns, you die.

Curing rabid:
* Generally the same guidelines for illness apply, but there are a couple important differences to know about.
* **You cannot use a unicorn horn to heal rabid status!**
* You can drink healing potions (before the fear of water sets in)
* You can cast cure illness
* You can pray (counts as a major trouble)
* You can eat a eucalyptus leaf or a clove of garlic
* You can eat the corpse of a dog (tinned or otherwise)
* You can be healed and cured by a nurse
* You can rub a non-cursed foulstone (ie: "madstone").  When the foulstone is used this way, it autocurses and becomes a dangerous item again.
* Rabid monsters that poly can stop being rabid if the new form is immune - the same goes for the player.

### Diseased monsters
* Ported from EvilHack
* Monsters can become infected with terminal illness, with a short countdown to death.
* Monsters can cure themselves if they have the means, and the player can use cure sickness or eucalyptus leaves to heal sick pets.
* Currently, the only weapon that causes disease is Grimtooth.

### Accurate behavior
* Ported from EvilHack, with modifications
* Monsters with this property have the M3_ACCURATE tag
* Makes monsters more accurate in melee and with projectiles
* These monsters get a large to-hit bonus of +5 or more
* Players are the elven starting race or polymorphed into elves also enjoy a to-hit bonus that scales with your level.

### Jumping behavior
* Ported from EvilHack/SpliceHack
* Lets monsters jump at you from a few squares away, quickly bridging the gap between you
* They can also cross short barriers like water and lava and even jump over other monsters

### Withering attacks
* Ported from xNetHack and EvilHack
* Withering is a nasty new attack that will give the player the "wither" status temporarily. Whilst withering you will lost 1HP per turn.
* If you are already withering and the new wither attack is strong enough, it will also drain some of your maximum HP, making this threat quite insidious.
* Withering can be cured by quaffing holy water, praying, or invoking the Staff of Aesculapius.
* Any item that grants extrinsic disintegration res also grants withering resistance (black dragon scales, shield of integrity)
* When playing as a vampire, you will also enjoy withering resistance by virtue of being undead.
* All mummies possess wither attacks.
* Powerful clerics can also cast the Blight spell at range which can cause withering.


## MONSTER SPELLCASTING


* Monsters can target and cast spells at other monsters (EvilHack).
* Peaceful monsters won't cast make invisible on themselves. They also won't drink potions
  of invisibility or zap themselves with wands of make invisible.
* Monster spellcasters will prioritize healing when wounded.
* Monster spellcasters can cast stone-to-flesh in response to getting stoned (Evil).
* Don't let monster cleric stunning reset stun counter to 1 when stunned.

### Clerical Spells

**protection (EvilHack)**
* This is the monster version of the protection spell already available to the player.
* Provides a temporary magical shield that increases the monster's AC protection.
* Can be dissipated with a blast of cancellation.

**geyser spell**
* The core spell is unchanged from Vanilla NetHack, however now the geyser also rusts armor and instakills iron golems (Evil)

**hobble**
* This clerical spell smashes the hero's legs with a magical force and inflicts you with wounded legs for a brief period
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero from up to 13 squares away.

**blight (xNetHack)**
* In xnh, this spell was reserved for 'dark speech' - a nasty group of curses that Asmodeus and Demogorgon can use. But it was extracted out and used as a new clerical spell which inflicts withering on the player.
* The duration of the withering lasts 20-60 turns. It can also be cast up to 8 squares away.

**flesh to stone**
* This is the highest level clerical spell
* When cast it can start the stoning process on the hero.

### Mage Spells
**reflection (EvilHack)**
* A spell that creates a shimmering globe around the caster, granting them reflection for several turns.
* Can be dissipated with a blast of cancellation.

**acid blast (EvilHack)**
* Explodes an acid blast on its target and the surrounding squares. The damage output is dependent on the level of the monster casting it.
* The acid from this spell also has a chance of eroding any unprotected weapons or armor in open inventory.
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero up to 13 squares away.

**ice bolt (EvilHack)**
* This spell explodes a small ice storm upon its target (and surrounding squares)
* Any non-protected objects in open inventory are subject to being frozen.
* This is a low-level spell, so access to this spell is given to every monster spellcaster that has access to mage-based spells.
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero up to 13 squares away.

**fire bolt (EvilHack)**
* This spell explodes a small fireball upon its target  (and surrounding squares)
* Any flammable objects in open inventory are subject to being burned.
* This is a low-level spell, so access to this spell is given to every monster spellcaster that has access to mage-based spells.
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero up to 13 squares away.

**destroy armor**
* Altered from Vanilla NetHack, ported from EvilHack
* Having magic resistance is no longer full protection against this spell. Any piece of armor being worn can have its fixed status removed, and then can be deteriorated to the point that it's completely destroyed. Even armor that is normally erodeproof (dragonhide and dragon scales, etc) is affected. Having MR keeps the erosion level at one per cast, otherwise the erosion level is of one to three levels per cast. Blessed pieces of armor have a small chance of resisting. Armor-based quest artifacts are immune to this spell, as is crystal plate mail.

**entomb (xNetHack)**
* Used by a monster when they are low on health or fleeing. It is primarily for escape and when cast surrounds the player with boulders.
* Any mage-spellcaster can use it when desperate.
* In xnh there was also a chance to create solid walls to block the player in, this effect was removed so it only drops boulders.

**call undead**
* Ported from SLASHEM
* Call Undead can only be cast by undead and demon spellcasters
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero from up to 13 squares away.

**evil eye (dNetHack)**
* When successfully cast on the hero it lowers your Luck by 1 point.
* Evil eye can only be cast by undead and demon spellcasters.
* Because this is implemented as a gaze attack, the player can increase their protection by being invisible or displaced. There is no maximum range to this spell.

**cure self**
* Spellcasters can use this to cure illness, blindness, withering, and rabid statuses.

### Undead Slayer

The **Undead Slayer** has been implemented as a new role, distinct from the Priest. This rework includes a fresh quest storyline in which the player must reclaim *The Argent Cross* from *The First Evil*. Custom quest levels include the desecrated monastery, haunted catacombs, and The Abyssal Vaults. Unlike the divine spellcasting Priest, the Undead Slayer is a dedicated warrior whose sole mission is to purge the undead.

This version of the Undead Slayer blends old and new mechanics, making it a more challenging role early on but highly rewarding in the endgame. Undead Slayers begin with **drain resistance, sickness resistance, and warning against undead.** They start with **slow movement (speed 10)** as they did in SLASH’EM, but they gain to-hit and damage bonuses against undead and demons. One unique trait is their ability to **completely obliterate zombies, preventing them from leaving corpses.** However, they receive significant alignment and Luck penalties for consuming wraith corpses. Their special spell is *Protection*. They can be of any alignment and may choose from **human, gnome, elf, dwarf, grung, or dhampir** as their starting race.

Undead Slayers also start with a **revenant hound**, a new undead canine with numerous resistances and the ability to phase through walls. These creatures do not eat, so they are tamed via `#chat` rather than food. In terms of weapon skills, Undead Slayers can now reach **skilled in riding and basic in short swords.**

However, there are several things they *do not* get. They **lack stealth, poison resistance, and speed.** They do not receive a guaranteed sacrifice gift or any special techniques. Unlike Priests and Knights, they **cannot turn undead.** Additionally, they do not start with a silver pistol or silver bullets, but a new fourth starting kit has been substituted which features a silver short sword and leather cloak. While they can reach **expert** in Daggers, they are still **ineffective at multi-throwing.**

Undead Slayers also face additional challenges, as **undead and demons always spawn hostile.** To support this, wooden stakes and holy wafers have been ported from SLASH’EM. The wooden stake has been enhanced with **staking mechanics from xNetHack**, allowing for **instakills on vampires**. Holy wafers now have the ability to **stop withering.** The quest levels have also been redesigned, drawing inspiration from dNetHack's Binder quest.

The **new quest artifact** is *The Argent Cross*, an **artifact amulet of reflection** that grants **half spell damage reduction and withering resistance** when worn. It also acts as an **artifact light source**. When blessed, it will periodically activate the `#turn undead` effect without requiring the player to stand still. However, if cursed, if your god is angry, or if you are non-chaotic and polymorphed into an evil form, it will instead **aggravate monsters.** The cross follows the same activation timer as clairvoyance, triggering every **15-45 turns** after the last activation.

The **new quest nemesis** is *The First Evil*, who guards *The Argent Cross* and the *Bell of Opening*. This is a **high-level evil shade** with an arsenal of powerful abilities. It can cast mage spells and possesses **deadly touch attacks** that **paralyze, slow, freeze, and shock** its foes. Additionally, it is highly resistant to various forms of damage, including **cold, disintegration, stoning, sleep, poison, acid, and electricity.**


### Cartomancer
* The cartomancer is a unique role ported over from SpliceHack. Cartomancers are spellcasters with a focus on using cards and summoning temporary minions to do their bidding. Many parts of the role are inspired by or pay homage to various trading card games. The cartomancer has undergone some dramatic transformations from its original implementation in Splice, becoming a more focused and surprising role to play.

**Starting inventory:**
    * graphic tee
    * 40 blessed +2 razor cards
    * ~4 meat sticks
    * ~4 candy bars
    * 7 blessed summon raven cards
    * 1 random rulebook
    * 4 potions of phasing
    * sack
    * a playing card deck or a deck of fate

**Intrinsics:**

| XL  | Intrinsic                                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |

**Quest artifact**
The **Holographic Void Lily** is a quest artifact that functions as a chaotic credit card. When carried, it grants energy regeneration, half spell damage and reflection. Additionally, it can be invoked to provide a temporary boost in card drops, during which the Void Lily will shine brightly for 25-50 turns. This invocation effect replaces the original #invoke ability from SpliceHack, where it previously summoned a large group of random monsters.

**Cartomancer terminology**
Whilst playing as a cartomancer, much of the standard NetHack terminology is revised:

| item               | renamed as          |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| scrolls            | "cards"             |
| spellbooks         | "rulebooks"         |
| credit cards       | "banned cards"      |
| boomerangs         | "bent cards"        |
| expensive cameras  | "holographic cards" |
| hawaiian shirts    | "graphic tees"      |
| lock picks         | "worthless cards"   |
| scrolls under $100 | "common"            |
| scrolls for $100   | "uncommon"          |
| scrolls for $200   | "rare"              |
| scrolls for $300   | "legendary"         |
* Whenever you or a monster reads a scroll, they instead "play" that card.

**Cartomancer rarity descriptions**
Scrolls are also labeled according to their rarity. In the original SpliceHack implementation, this reflected the price. So a $100 card would be "uncommon", a $200 card would be rare, and so on. With the nerfing of price identification, this system has been revised so that the actual probability of cards is reflected. The following chart describes how this works.

| Card            | Rarity | Description |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| cloning         | 10     | legendary   |
| charging        | 15     | legendary   |
| exile           | 15     | legendary   |
| knowledge       | 15     | legendary   |
| taming          | 15     | legendary   |
| punishment      | 15     | legendary   |
| stinking cloud  | 15     | legendary   |
| earth           | 18     | rare        |
| food detection  | 25     | rare        |
| fire            | 30     | rare        |
| gold detection  | 33     | rare        |
| amnesia         | 35     | rare        |
| flood           | 35     | rare        |
| scare monster   | 35     | rare        |
| magic mapping   | 45     | uncommon    |
| destroy armor   | 45     | uncommon    |
| create monster  | 45     | uncommon    |
| confuse monster | 53     | uncommon    |
| teleportation   | 55     | uncommon    |
| enchant armor   | 63     | common      |
| remove curse    | 65     | common      |
| enchant weapon  | 80     | common      |
| light           | 90     | common      |
| identify        | 180    | common      |

**Card abuse penalties**
* Cartomancers receive severe alignment penalties for forging or defacing cards.
  - writing cards: -20 alignment, -5 luck
  - cloning cards: -20 alignment, -5 luck
  - polymorphing cards: -10 alignment, -2 luck

**Play mechanics**
* Cards (scrolls) only weigh 1 for cartomancers.
* Rulebooks (spellbooks) only weigh 5 for cartomancers.
* The camera is played as a holographic card for cartomancers, doesn't break when thrown.
* When applying a deck of cards, cartomancers will always be able to use them as if they
  were blessed.
  - For playing card decks, this enables you to easily evaluate your current luck.
  - For decks of fate, you will have a bonus toward a better result.
* Cartomancers don't break illiterate conduct when playing cards.

**No perma-pets**
Cartomancers do not receive a starting pet and are unable to tame monsters in the usual way. When food is thrown at domestic animals, it only pacifies them rather than taming them. Any figurines that generate are automatically converted into summon cards, and the rulebook of create familiar also produces summon cards instead of familiars. All standard methods of creating permanent pets have been nullified for Cartomancers. On the Astral Plane, they receive an archon card in place of a guardian angel. When reading a confused scroll of cloning, they will simply receive a summon card instead of a possible tame pet.

**Melee combat nerfs**
* Cartomancers are not great melee fighters - they prefer ranged weapons or fighting behind their summoned help. They have some severe penalties for melee combat.
* There is a flat -5 to-hit penalty for all melee combat.
* If wearing armor, they receive an additional -20 to-hit penalty
* If wearing a shield, they receive an additional -10 to-hit penalty
* If attacking with a wielded weapon, they receive an additional -10 to-hit penalty.
* Cartomancers get messages (similar to monks) for cumbersome armor and shields.

**Card drops**
When playing as a cartomancer, there is a chance that a monster will leave a card instead of a corpse upon death. Initially, this chance is 50%, but as you level up and progress deeper into the dungeon, the chance gradually decreases. When a monster dies and is eligible for a drop, one of three outcomes can occur: a razor card (with any BUC status or enchantment) may be dropped, a zap card may appear, or a summon card might be left behind. Summon drops are the most complex, as they can vary depending on RNG. The drop could be the same card as the monster that was killed, a higher difficulty monster, a random monster, or a sphere. If the monster is low level (below 3), it often doesn't leave any card. However, nasty monsters always drop their own summon cards.

* Some monsters are restricted from dropping cards:
  * spell beings
  * revived monsters (zombies and trolls that have been killed once and come back)
  * cancelled monsters
  * phoenixes (they always leave an egg)
  * cloned monsters (gremlins, blue jellies, etc.)
  * Keystone Kops (they can be farmed)
* Cartomancers don't get card drops whilst polymorphed.

**Spell beings**
Spell beings originally came from SLASH'EM. Whenever the flame sphere or freeze sphere spells were cast, they would summon a temporary sphere, which counted as a spell being. These beings are tame and act like pets, but they have a limited lifespan. (In SLASH'EM, there was no lifespan unless you left them on a level, causing them to become untame.) Here, when the cartomancer plays a summon card, it will summon a spell being with a predetermined lifespan that will fight aggressively for you, ignoring any hesitation a regular pet might exhibit and never stopping to eat or hide. If you receive credit for killing a spell being, they only grant 1 XP. Spell beings never leave corpses and spawn with no inventory. Spell-beings also don't count toward vanquished or special logged monsters.

Spell beings have a "sparkling" description in farlook, so you can distinguish them from permanent monsters.

**Lifetime of spell-beings:**

| XPLev | Turns |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 19    |
| 5     | 35    |
| 10    | 55    |
| 15    | 75    |
| 20    | 95    |
| 25    | 115   |
| 30    | 135   |

**Summon cards**
For cartomancers, cards of create monster are twice as common as for other roles, and when these cards spawn, they are keyed to a specific summon monster card. Cartomancers begin the game with seven summon raven cards and have opportunities to expand their collection as they slay monsters. Whilst low-level monsters rarely drop their own summon cards, there is always a small chance that any death drop will leave a higher-level monster card. As the cartomancer's level increases, so does the strength of these rare drops.

The price of summon cards scales according to the difficulty of the monster they summon. In addition to reading summon cards, cartomancers can also throw them to activate the effect, which allows them to summon monsters at a distance, directly next to a threat.

Monsters can also read summon cards, so it’s important for cartomancers to collect them before they are used against them. Cursed summon cards will always create hostile monsters.

Activating summon cards costs 5 energy per card. If the cartomancer lacks enough energy, the card will have no effect and will not be consumed. Unique monsters can drop summon cards, with a few exceptions, such as the Wizard of Yendor and the Riders, due to their ability to revive. Additionally, cartomancers can receive summon cards by offering corpses. Although these cards do not count as artifact gifts they will still increase the prayer timeout.

**Explosive summon cards**
Summon "sphere" cards are special because they instantly explode when thrown at a monster. However, if cursed, they will not explode and instead summon a hostile sphere, which includes gas spores and volatile mushrooms. Exploding sphere monster cards are more likely to drop for cartomancers, providing them with useful ranged explosive options.

These monster cards are eligible for this mechanic:
* freezing spheres
* flaming spheres
* acid spheres
* shocking spheres
* stinking spheres
* volatile mushrooms
* gas spores

**Razor cards**
In **NerfHack**, razor cards have been properly implemented as their own weapon type, using the shuriken skill, unlike in **SpliceHack**, where they were simply renamed shuriken. Razor cards deal 1d6 damage to both small and large creatures, have a +2 to-hit bonus, and weigh 1. Cartomancers can multishot with shuriken-skill projectiles, such as shuriken and razor cards, and they gain multishot bonuses up to expert skill. However, they do not receive additional multishot bonuses at master skill level, though they still benefit from increased damage and to-hit bonuses.

Razor cards will occasionally appear as part of a cartomancer’s regular death drops, sometimes replacing summon or zap cards. These follow the same rules as stacked weapons, so they may appear in stacks of 6-11 and could be blessed, cursed, unblessed, or possibly even poisoned. The strength damage bonus applies exclusively to thrown razor cards, and no other projectile qualifies for this bonus.

If a player comes across a deck of cards that they have no use for, they can #tip the deck to empty it, yielding a potentially large stack of razor cards.

**Zappable cards**
Zap cards, which function as one-use wands, can drop when cartomancers kill monsters. These cards have a 0% generation chance for other roles, meaning only cartomancers will encounter them. Cursed zap cards have a chance to backfire like wands, but they cannot explode. Playing zap cards requires 5 energy per card.

Cartomancers will never see wands generate. Anytime a wand would spawn it is instead replaced with its equivalent zap card. It's important to note that monsters can and will use both zap and summon cards against the player, so it's crucial to collect them as soon as they drop.

**Spellcasting overhaul**
Cartomancers do not learn spells in the traditional way, meaning they cannot acquire spells from starting books, reading spellbooks, or receiving gifts from gods. Instead, they cast spells instantaneously by reading rulebooks. These rulebooks generate with 4-5 charges, and each reading consumes one charge. Once all charges are used, the rulebook is consumed and disappears.

Cartomancers begin the game knowing the identities of all rulebooks, as the title and purpose of a rulebook are typically clear from the cover. They always cast spells at expert level, ensuring high proficiency. Whilst rulebooks can still be written using magic markers without penalties (unlike when forging cards), they cannot be recharged with scrolls of charging. Additionally, cartomancers are fortunate enough to know braille, allowing them to invoke their rulebooks even while blind.

**Card combos:**
* The 'Z' spellcasting command is instead is used for card combos that the cartomancer gets access to as they level up.
* Card combos do not become available until level 5. You gain the ability to cast more cards as you level up:
  * level 5: 3 cards
  * level 10: 4 cards
  * level 15+: 5 cards
* Starting the combo costs 5 energy. Further cards cost 5 energy per card to play as normal.

**Cartomancers get special bonuses for wielding crystal balls:**
Whilst wielding a crystal ball, a cartomancer will enjoy:
    * max charisma
    * telepathy
    * see invisible
    * astral vision

**Changes to the cartomancer quest:**
* Created a unique duelist monster to take the place of students in the cartomancer quest.
* The cartomancer quest levels have received some updates and detailing.
* Buffed the King of Games and Dal Zethire.

### Racial item preferences

* Orcs get a -1AC bonus for each piece of orcish equipment they were.

* Monsters of certain races will usually prefer their own equipment and find other racial equipment awkward or uncomfortable to use.
  * Elves hate dwarvish, gnomish, and orcish objects
  * Orcs hate dwarvish, gnomish, and elven objects
  * Dwarves hate orcish, gnomish, and elven objects
  * Gnomes hate dwarvish, orcish, and elven objects
  * Humans/vampires hate gnomish objects (too small) - but otherwise they can use all other racial equipment

The effects of wearing armor or wielding weapons you hate:
* +2AC penalty for each piece
* -d5 to-hit penalty for each piece
* To make the mechanic obvious, you receive an explicit message when wearing or wielding any hated object.
* You'll also receive periodic messages when fighting to remind you your to-hit is suffering.
* When throwing items your race dislikes, they have a 1 in 7 chance of slipping - same as a cursed or greased projectile.

This mechanic also applies to monsters, but they will also simply avoid using items they don't like.


## NEW RACES


### Dhampir

Vampires have a rich history in NetHack, first appearing in SLASH'EM and later in UnNetHack, dNetHack, SpliceHack, and Hack'EM, with each variant implementing them slightly differently. However, in NerfHack, vampires take a U-turn from the traditional design due to their overwhelming power. As a playable race, they allowed players to bypass too many core mechanics and obstacles, including newly introduced features.

For instance, their **immunity to withering** made mummies and priests trivial threats, while **immunity to rabies** negated an entirely new mechanic. **Poison resistance** let them fight deadly monsters like orcs or team a without fear, and **sleep resistance** nullified sleep rays. Beyond resistances, their innate abilities made the game even easier: their hardcoded vampire bat and fog cloud polyforms rendered polytraps meaningless, **flying** allowed them to **bypass ground traps, water, and icy floors**, and **regeneration** gave them an immense edge in combat. All of these factors stripped away much of the game's intended challenge, particularly in the early stages.

**A Balanced Alternative: The Dhampir**

To address these issues, a **lesser type of vampire—the Dhampir (or half-vampire)**—was introduced. This new race retains some of the vampire's strengths but is far more balanced, fitting alongside other vanilla races. The Dhampir preserves the appeal of playing as a vampire while maintaining the integrity of the game's mechanics and difficulty.

Dhampirs start with **resistance to draining and death magic**, and being **breathless**, they are immune to **gas, spores, choking, and drowning**. They also possess **lycanthropy resistance and infravision**. However, **all partial intrinsics are capped at 50%**, even when granted through crowning, ensuring they rely more on extrinsic protections.

Dhampirs **excel at climbing** and can easily escape pits. Their standout ability is a **1d6 draining bite**, which **heals HP** when feeding on blood — replacing the vampire's intrinsic regeneration. As an added bonus, they can **absorb partial intrinsics from drained monsters**, such as **fire, cold, and sleep resistance**. These changes make the dhampir a compelling yet balanced alternative to the overpowered vampire race.

To prevent "stupid deaths," **bite attacks are automatically prevented** when facing dangerous foes such as **cockatrices, Medusa, or green slimes** — even if the player is only polymorphed into a vampire. However, **stunned, confused, or hallucinating dhampirs will bite indiscriminately**, making careful gameplay crucial when impaired.

Dhampirs also come with a major weakness — **innate hunger**. This forces players to stay aggressive, attack often, and keep draining blood for nutrition. The corpse draining mechanic from SLASH'EM was never ported due to bugs in the nutrition code and tedious corpse draining mechanics, and wasted corpses. Instead, SpliceHack's approach was adopted, where **life blood feeding in combat now provides more nutrition**. The tradeoff is that **Dhampirs can no longer eat nor gain benefits from eating corpses**.

NerfHack introduces smarter feeding to regulate vampire bite mechanics:
- Low-level dhampir can only use either a bite attack or weapon attack, but not both in the same round.
- If the vampire is hungry (or close to hungry), they will always bite and attempt to feed first.
- Otherwise, there is a 50/50 chance of either biting or attacking with a weapon.
- The ability to combine a bite with a weapon attack is locked until Level 6.
- After **Level 6**, vampires can perform **both biting and weapon attacks in the same round**.
- If a player **wants to avoid biting**, they can forcefight using `"F"` to **only use their weapon attack**.
- Dhampir also feed more efficiently when their victims are confused, incapacitated, or trapped.

These updates ensure that dhampirs remain strong but balanced, requiring strategy and resource management rather than bypassing core mechanics.

#### Dhampir's resistances and abilities

| XL  | Intrinsic                   |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| 1   | Infravision                 |
| 1   | Warning vs humans and elves |
| 1   | Breathless                  |
| 1   | Drain resistance            |
| 1   | Immune to death magic       |
| 1   | Immune to lycanthropy       |

Although dhampir have drain level resistance, they remain **vulnerable to blood-draining bite attacks** from other vampirics. Intrinsic drain resistance does not protect against these attacks, but an extrinsic source, such as the Stormbringer, will.

In terms of food, **most rations and fruit juice potions are replaced with blood potions** when playing as a dhampir. This avoids creating junk items and helps the player survive longer. Some vampires receive an opera cloak, though it is rarer than in SLASH'EM, and **wearing an opera cloak grants a charisma bonus**, as in UnNetHack. Potions of blood and vampire blood offer vampires a drinkable food source. Dhampir can use any racial items, except for gnomish items, which are too small for them.

**Silver weapons also generate more frequently **when playing as a dhampir. After difficulty level 8 kicks in, 10% of all eligible weapons will be converted to silver. Dhampir can handle silver items, but if they come into direct contact (ie: wielding a silver saber without gloves), they will take some damage and be unable to regenerate further HP.


### Grung

**Grung** are a nasty little race of frog-like people known for their toxic skin, sharp teeth, vibrant colors, and lack of long tongues. The featured race here is the green grung. Their **skin naturally secretes poison**, giving them a **passive poison attack**. In combat, they can **poison enemies when striking barehanded**. Although their poison is only about half as strong as a standard poisoned weapon attack, it is still very efficient at wiping out enemies that don't resist poison. Additionally, they can **dip their weapons into their own skin** to coat them with venom for extra lethality.

Grung possess several natural abilities. They have **resistance to poison** and are adept at **searching**. Their natural agility allows them to **swim effortlessly**, and as they gain experience, they achieve **jumping ability (XP5)** and **speed (XP7)**.

One of the grung's **biggest concerns is hydration**.

#### Grung Hydration Mechanics

- **Hydration Requirement:** Grung **must stay wet to survive**
- **Hydration Timer:** Starts at **6000** and counts down every turn
- **Penalties for Low Hydration:**
  - Below **1000** → **Speed and combat penalties**
  - At **0** → **Instant death**
- **Dehydration Accelerators:**
  - **Fire, heat, and dry environments** speed up dehydration
  - **Fire resistance** can **reduce some effects**
- **Methods of Rehydration:**

Grung have several strengths in combat. Their **Dexterity-based armor class (AC) bonus** is **slightly increased and doubled** compared to other races. They also gain a **to-hit bonus against kamadan** and can **always reach skilled proficiency in darts**. However, they also have notable weaknesses. They **cannot wear boots** and strongly **dislike heavy or bulky armor**, though they are comfortable wearing racial armor as long as it isn’t cumbersome — mithril is a good choice. Additionally, their **passive poison ability does not function** while wearing **bulky armor**. Grung are particularly vulnerable to **dust vortices**, which accelerate their dehydration process.

## SPELLCASTING CHANGES


Most of these changes are to strengthen natural spellcasters abilities and to dull roles
that don't specialize (like fighters). Non-specialists can still attempt to utilize spells
but they will have to work harder to maintain their spells. Cavemen will have a very
difficult time with spellcasting.

### Spell memory
* The base memory retention ("KEEN") for spells is now 20000 turns for primary spellcasters and 10000 for all other roles.
* When reading or re-reading a spellbook, you will bring the retention back up to your roles KEEN value.
* Reading restricted spellbooks only grants **half*** of your role's KEEN value.
* Primary spellcasters (healers, priests, monks, wizards, archeologists) get a memory boost of 500 turns when they cast spells (SLASH'EM).
* Casting your **special spell** also grants a retention bonus of 500 turns no matter what role you are

### Other spellcasting changes
* Removed the spellbook of identify (xnh)
* Wielding a quarterstaff provides a small bonus to spellcasting (about a 1/3rd of the bonus a robe confers) (Fourk)
* Hungerless casting ignores too hungry to cast penalty (xnh)
* Spellbooks' weight is directly related to their level (xnh)
* When casting a SKILLED attack spell, you can choose to cast basic fireball or cone of cold (xnh/dnh)
* You get a 100 turn reminder for spells that are close to fading away
* Spellcasting no longer exercises wisdom (FIQ)
* Total hungerless casting is not possible anymore and the intelligence requirements have been increased. (FIQ)
* Only primary spellcasters can receive divine spellbook gifts
* Spellbooks can generate pre-read
* Display a single accurate spellcasting retention percentage in the spellbook list


### New skill-dependent spell ranges
* Your skill in a spell directly affects how far its ray or beam will travel:

**spellbook of fire bolt**
The damage calculations have been revamped from HackEM:
* Base damage is 1d10 fire damage
* At skilled it deals 2d10 fire damage
* At expert it deals 3d10 fire damage
* At level 5 it deals an additional +1d4 damage
* At level 11 it deals an additional +1d4 damage
* At level 17 it deals an additional +1d4 damage
* If the target resists cold a bonus +7 damage is applied.

This means if the player has maxxed out their attack spell skill and leveled up to XP21, they could be dealing 3d10+3d4 with a level 1 spell.


**spellbooks of healing and extra healing**
* Healing power scales with skill level

| spell         | Unskilled | Basic | Skilled | Expert |
| ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| healing       | 4d4       | 6d4   | 8d4     | 10d4   |
| extra healing | 4d8       | 6d8   | 8d8     | 10d8   |


**spellbook of light**
* Spell of light's diameter of effect scales with spellcasting ability.
* For reference, the uncursed scroll of light always illuminates a radius of 11.

|       | Unskilled | Basic | Skilled | Expert |
| ----- | --------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| range | 1         | 3     | 5       | 7      |

**spellbook of magic mapping**

* The effectiveness of magic mapping depends on your spellcasting ability. The spell will never fully map a level, only the scroll can be depended upon for that.
* Lowered from level 5 to level 4
* Unskilled acts like a confused magic mapping (1 in 7 squares successfully mapped)
* Basic maps 1 in 5 squares
* Skilled maps 1 in 3 squares
* Expert maps all squares

**spellbook of magic missile**

Damage scales with level. Unskilled now deals half the damage expert can.

|       | Unskilled    | Basic        | Skilled      | Expert       |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| range | ((XL/2)+1)d3 | ((XL/2)+1)d4 | ((XL/2)+1)d5 | ((XL/2)+1)d6 |

### Sokoban

* Sokoban levels are cold and icy - legend has it a white dragon named Wintercloak took the tower over, leaving a trail of frost in its wake. In addition to the level being colored blue with splashes of icey cyan, you will see random patches of ice form in the level. Because they are cold, if potions land on the floor, they have a chance of freezing and shattering.
* Note: A recent change from NetHack 3.7 also makes ice occasionally slide the player in a random direction.
* Sokoban now has two additional levels - an entry level with river obstacles (adapted from the town filler level from UnNetHack) and another puzzle level to solve.
* Monsters are never generated peaceful in Sokoban (FIQ)
* Zombies don't revive in Sokoban and they won't dig out of the ground.

* Winged gargoyles replace 4 of the original gargoyles
* 2 ghoul mages were added

### Lost Tomb level
* Ported from SLASH'EM - this level now has some additional rooms (and treasures) with randomized passages.
* A second variation was created using Demogorgon's Lair from xNetHack. This level had a very mazelike structure that lends itself well to a lost tomb (but with no Demogorgon of course...).
* Both lost tomb levels are no-teleport

### The Wyrm Caves
* Ported from SLASH'EM as it was
* This level offer the player a small but difficult branch. There may be the promise of dragon scales in addition to various loot.
* Occurs from levels 20-21

### Big Room
* Ported bigroom variants from UnNetHack and SpliceHack.
* Imported two bigroom variants from xnh.
* An additional big room was added to the latter half of the main dungeon (Splice)

### Grass
* Ported using code from xNetHack, SpliceHack, and HackEM.
* Monsters can hide under grass (xnh).
* You cannot dust engrave on grassy tiles.
* Burned engravings also burn up grass.
* Added grass to big rooms.

### Puddles
* Ported from EvilHack and SlashTHEM.
* Puddles act as a nerf for early water sources by limiting a useful resource for diluting and blanking items.
* Many pools are replaced with puddles instead.
* Fountains gush out puddles instead of pools
* Disarming a rust trap results in a puddle instead of a fountain
* Scrolls of flood mostly create puddles instead of pools (unless cursed)
* Whetstones can be used in puddles and can dry up puddles.
* Tiny monsters can drown in puddles (relevant if polymorphed into one)

### Forges
* Forges were ported in from EvilHack
* Forges let the player repair metallic armor, bless items, dispose of zombies or organic items, dispose of the iron ball and chain, and summon lava demons and fire elementals.
* Forging recipes are available in the object lookup
* Weapons can be forged by applying a hammer whilst standing on a forge.
* Items can pass over forges.
* New forging feature: There is a one-time 1 in 30 chance of erodeproofing an item when dipping in a forge. After this occurs, the forge will instead emit a puff of steam.
* Forges always light up the square they occupy.
* Cold rays have a chance cool forges.
* Forges burn the grease and poison off dipped items.
* You cannot forge while confused, stunned, hallucinating, weak from hunger, or with STR under 4.

#### Forging and Forging Recipes
* Ported from EvilHack with modifications.
* No artifact forging
* No armor recipes are available if you aren't a dwarf or orc.
* Much narrower list of forgeable weapons, mostly bladed and blunt weapons.
* Only samurai can forge katanas, tsurugi, and shuriken.
* Only dwarves can forge dwarvish items
* Only orcs can forge orcish items
* Forging recipes are displayed in the object lookup.

Aside from the recipe changes - the biggest change is that we no longer have a #forge or #craft command. Simply get a hammer and (a)pply it when standing over the forge.

### Toilets
Toilets have received many enhancements after adapting them from SLASHEM. Notably, toilets can now appear on their own, separate from sinks, whereas in SLASH'EM, they only came in pairs with sinks. Overall, their frequency has been dialed way back so they are quite rare.

* Toilet prayer can now stop the vomiting process
* Praying at toilets can cure sickness.
* Sitting on toilets can alleviate satiated status.
* If giants sit on toilets, they break.
* Sitting on toilets fully heals your HP.
* Toilets can sometimes break when sat on.
* Dipping potions into toilets only contaminates potions into sickness.

#### Toilet kicking:
* Like sinks, toilets now have a couple different effects from kicking them, including a few YAFM.
* Kicking now only breaks the toilet 1/7 chance (was 1/4 in SLASH'EM)
* Kicking can generate giant cockroaches and pools from kicking (1 in 17 chance)
* Kicking can generate brown puddings (only once per toilet)
* Kicking can generate a random tool. Normally this tool will weigh under 15aum, but sometimes you'll get a large tool that bonks against the piping. If a large tool bonks 3x - you'll get that tool no matter now big it is and the toilet is destroyed in the process.

Dipping an edged weapon into a toilet can poison it, but also probably rust any metallic items.

### Bloody tiles
* Ported from SpliceHack
* When a monster is killed, it can spray blood around the surrounding tiles depending on it's size.
* The blood is mostly cosmetic, however, players cannot engrave in the dust whilst blood covers that tile.
* Blood can be wiped off with a towel, or will wear off after enough activity.
* Fire and acid rays also burn off blood from tiles.
* Bloody doors are more difficult to open and close.

### Traps
* Polytraps always disappear whenever a monster steps on one.
* Invisibility from magic traps lasts a long time (2500-5000 turns), instead of permanently.
* Anti-magic fields block spellcasting for the player and monsters
* Anti-magic fields also block wand zapping
* Arrow traps and dart traps cannot be avoided by flight.

* **Partially reverted commit 5c7c9d10a from 3.7.0** - Rejigger anti-magic traps. I thought the severity of the
  original change was actually fine, anti-magic traps were historically a joke in NetHack
  3.4.3 so this makes them somewhat threatening.

#### New container traps
* A cream pie may spring out of the box and hit the player in the face.
* A small critter (rat, snake, or spider) maybe jump out of the container, briefly scaring the player.
* The hinges on the container may screech loudly, waking up nearby monsters.

#### Falling rock traps
* At higher levels, boulders can drop from falling rock traps.
* Falling rock traps can result in stunning
* Falling rock traps can drop multiple rocks (or boulders).
* You cannot fly over falling rock traps.
* You can now #untrap falling rock traps, obtaining rocks (Fourk).

#### Spear traps
* A new floor trap ported from EvilHack
* Spear traps only start appearing after level 5
* Spear traps can be untrapped, potentially yielding a random spear type in the process.
* Flying and levitation usually protect from being harmed by spear traps, however, there is still a 25% chance of being hit (by a abnormally long spear)
* If you or a monster hit by the trap is thick-skinned, the spear just breaks and the trap is deleted.
* The trap also doesn't affect unsolid monsters.
* When hit, it deals 7-14 damage and wounds your legs for 10-19 turns.
* Spear traps sometimes have poisoned spears.
* Spear traps abuse strength and constitution.

#### Magic beam traps
* A new trap ported from EvilHack
* Magic beam traps only start appearing after level 14
* When you (or a monster) steps on this trap, it shoots a random ray type from a pre-set location that crosses through the beam trap. The beam type is set for each trap, so once you notice it shoots fire rays, it will always shoot fire rays.
* Magic beam traps can very rarely shoot disintegration rays.

#### Grease traps
* A new creation debuting in NerfHack
* Grease traps function similarly to rust traps, but they spray a blast of grease at the player or monster that stepped on it.
* When you step on a grease trap, you either slip in a puddle of grease or get sprayed by a grease hose.
* When stepped on, the trap disarms with a random 1 in 15 chance.
* You can also #untrap grease traps, if successful you may yield a rubber hose or - in rare cases - a can of grease.

**Puddle of grease:**
  * If you don't have levitation or flying, you gain fumbling ("You step in a puddle of grease.")
  * If you have flying - you are covered in grease, lose flying, and are blinded by goop.
  * Slipping in grease traps can cause you or monsters to become paralyzed for a few turns and inflicts a small amount of damage.
  * Mud boots and water walking boots protect from slipping on grease traps.

**Grease hose:**
  * If the grease hits your head, you are blinded unless you are wearing a visored helmet. Your blindfold/lenses/etc may also become greased and fall off.
  * If the grease hits your arm, your weapon(s) or shield can become greased and fall off. You also gain the Glib condition for 10 to 15 turns.
  * If the grease hits your feet, your boots can become greased and fall off.
  * Otherwise, the grease hits your torso and your outermost armor becomes greased. Random items you are carrying can also become greased and fall from your possession. If you are carrying a towel, there is a 50% chance it becomes greased as well. If you are riding a steed the saddle will get hit with grease, making you fall off.
* When a monster gets hit with grease, it will randomly grease an item in their inventory.

Note: Getting hit by grease will not knock off worn cursed items.

#### Cold Traps
* Ported from xNetHack, originally from UnNetHack
* Cold traps are nasty and deal 4d8 cold damage, potentially shattering potions.
* If you have less than 25% cold resistance, you can have your HP drained similar to fire traps
* If you are 25% or more cold resistant, you may have a significant portion of your resistance (25-50%) sucked away by the trap.

#### Door traps
* Door traps actually explode in a ball of flame (Evil)
* These traps will start appearing at level 8.

#### Booby-trapped tins
* From xNetHack
* Randomly generated tins have a 1 in 30 chance of exploding in a blast of fire when opened.
* Tins that you create from tinning kits will always be safe.


## SPECIAL ROOMS


### Art rooms
* Ported from SpliceHack
* These rooms have a one-time event that occurs upon entering a room
* Most of the time it's a fun piece of art depicting something with the denizens of the dungeon. But sometimes it's a special effect.
  * You might see an image of your god, invoking enlightenment
  * You might find a partial map of the level
  * You might encounter a scary image, stunning you for a few turns
  * You might discover a new item
* Art rooms help exercise INT and WIS, depending on the room
* To get any effects, you must not be blind when you enter the room

### Room colors patch
* Most special rooms get a distinctive color or combination of colors.

### New room: dragon lair (from SLASH'EM).
* Dragon scales can sometimes appear in dragon lairs.
* Dragon lairs now produce special sounds when they appear on levels.

### New room: giant courtroom (from SLASH'EM).
* Giant courts sometimes have tinning kits.
* Monsters in giant courts are always hostile.

### New room: Real zoo (from SLASH'EM).
* Monsters in real zoos are always hostile.

### New room: Fungus farm (from SLASH'EM).
* Features a collection of slimy and oozy monsters.

### New room: Migo hive (from SLASH'EM).

### New room: terror halls (from SlashTHEM)
* Features a random assortment of U (hulk class) monsters


## ALTARS, PRAYER, AND PRIESTS


* When donating to priests - the gold vanishes upon receipt
* There is a greater chance of hostile minions appearing when converting an altar. Especially if the altar is in an occupied temple (Evil)
* Converting altars has higher chance of summoning minions (SLASH'EM)
* Intrinsics speed, stealth, and telepathy are no longer granted by the gods when #offering.
* Getting troubles fixed by prayer abuses constitution.
* Permanent alignment conversion prevents more divine protection from being granted
* Only one skill per game will be unrestricted by your god via artifact gifts.

Note regarding recent #offer gift changes in NetHack 3.7.0. These recent changes make the value the corpse offered matter in what artifacts are granted. In NerfHack, the framework of these changes was retained, however, the values of all artifacts have been lowered to 1 (the minimum), so as to preserve the original behavior of #offer gifts. Because there have already been strong changes to altars (cracking and XP dependent chances of gifts), the additional effect of monster value might be too much. The value of a monster still affects the chances of receiving altar luck though.

### Revised divine protection scheme
* The more protection the player has, the less likely it is to be granted (K-Mod)
* The maximum possible divine protection is capped at -9AC.
* When protection is granted from priests or your god, it is limited to increments of 1AC per granting.


| Current protection | Chance of fail |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| 0                  | 0%             |
| 1                  | 1%             |
| 2                  | 4%             |
| 3                  | 9%             |
| 4                  | 16%            |
| 5                  | 25%            |
| 6                  | 36%            |
| 7                  | 49%            |
| 8                  | 64%            |
| 9                  | 81%            |
| 10                 | 100%           |


### Altar cracking
**Once the player has received two gifts or has been crowned, altars have a 50% chance to crack with each subsequent gift.**

* There are two stages to the cracking. In the first stage the altar becomes partially cracked, which is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the altar's functionality. This cracked status can be seen on an altar by farlooking. However, receiving another gift from a cracked altar will certainly destroy it, losing it forever.
* Being crowned also counts as a gift. If you are crowned on a cracked altar, it will also almost always destroy it in the process (however - there is a 1 in 13 chance that the altar will survive the process).
* Altars on the Astral Plane will never be destroyed. Note that they can still become cracked but are safe from destruction.
* Many of the guaranteed altars in quests now have a good chance to already be cracked. This is especially true if they are unattended or unaligned, implying there was recent conflict and the altar was damaged.
* Converting an altar will also frequently crack it. This occurs 1 in 13 times the altar is converted or 1/3rd of the time hostile minions are summoned.
* Non-chaotic same-race sacrifice always cracks altars.

The original altar nerf came from SpliceHack, where altars had a 50% chance of being destroyed after two artifact gifts had been bestowed.

A new conduct was added to the #conduct menu so that players can track how many altars have been destroyed in their current game. Altar cracking is livelogged on game servers for the entertainment value.

### Altar generation
* **An uncracked altar is guaranteed to spawn at the Oracle's level.**
* Altars don't start spawning until level 15 (other than the Oracle altar)
* Randomly generated altars are always cracked after level 15.
* Temples cannot appear until level 15. Unlike random altars, temple altars will not be cracked, as they are maintained by a priest.


### #offer GIFT ODDS
**Altar gift frequency is tempered by your experience level (EvilHack).**

As your level increases, the probability of receiving an artifact increases. Under level 4 is not possible:
* level  4: 20% chance
* level  6: 30% chance
* level  8: 40% chance
* level 11: 50% chance
* level 13: 60% chance
* level 15: 70% chance
* level 17: 80% chance
* level 18: 90% chance
* level 20 or greater: 100% chance

This rewards leveling up and slows down the power grab that some characters might go for with a guaranteed sacrifice gift (ie: Barbarians). It also slows down the rate at which altars are cracking and getting destroyed, giving more time to utilize them for other things like building Luck or getting crowned.

* The raw odds of receiving an artifact have been adjusted in favor of the player, especially after 2 gifts have been granted.

| Gifts Granted | Old odds | New odds |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0             | 10.00%   | 12.50%   |
| 1             | 8.33%    | 10.00%   |
| 2             | 5.56%    | 8.33%    |
| 3             | 3.57%    | 7.14%    |
| 4             | 2.38%    | 6.25%    |
| 5             | 1.67%    | 5.56%    |
| 6             | 1.22%    | 5.00%    |
| 7             | 0.93%    | 4.55%    |
| 8             | 0.72%    | 4.17%    |
| 9             | 0.58%    | 3.85%    |
| 10            | 0.48%    | 3.57%    |

* The number of artiwishes is not factored in when determining the chance of a gift. The revised gift probabilities still apply, just filtered through the level check.

### Crowning
* Crowning requires 13 Luck (dNetHack).
* Crowning only provides a 50% increase in resistances.
* Intrinsic see invisible is no longer granted via crowning
* Intrinsic telepathy is no longer granted via crowning
* Crowning gifts are only granted when crowned, never for #offer.
* Your god will not crown you until you have completed the quest.
* Crowning makes it impossible to change alignment ever again.


## THE QUEST

* Removed the quest turn limit (Un)
* Players can enter the quest as soon as they reach level XL 10 (Un)
* Prevent the player from skipping most of the quest (xnh).
* Mark all quest levels as hardfloor.
* Players cannot do horizontal or downward teleporting whilst the quest nemesis is alive.


## INTRINSICS AND EXTRINSICS


* The new Saving Grace feature introduced in 3.7.0 has been disabled.
* The beginner flag is only set true for tourists. This means that you will usually be able to use-test items more effectively in the very early game.
* Invisibility and see invisible cannot be permanently gained intrinsically (xnh)
* Telepathy cannot be permanently gained intrinsically
* Teleportitis cannot be permanently gained intrinsically.
* Teleport control cannot be permanently gained intrinsically.
* Amnesia can make you forget intrinsic telepathy.
* Intrinsic disintegration resistance doesn't protect items from disintegration.

* Regeneration only causes additional hunger when it's actively healing your HP.
* When regeneration is active, it burns twice as much hunger.
* Free action protects from stoning paralysis.
* Magic resistance and spell damage reduction only halve magic missile damage instead of preventing it (Evil)
* The chance of gaining levels from wraiths has been reduced using the SLASH'EM version of edible wraith corpses.
* Strength gain nerfs: giant corpses have less of a chance of conferring strength gain (SLASHEM)
* Lessen confusing messages for confuse monster effects wearing off.
* Passive fire damage burns away slime.
* Unchanging pauses rather than cancels sliming (xnh)
* Phasing allows escape from being engulfed (Evil)
* Max carry capacity has been raised to 1250, with strength playing a larger factor in its calculation.
* Warn the player that invisibility is about to time out (xnh)
* There is an increased CON penalty for getting lifesaved (xNetHack).

### Partial Intrinsics
* Ported from EvilHack
* Instead of binary resistances where the player either has it or doesn't, the player gradually builds up their resistance from 0% to 100%.
* When eating a corpse, player gains a percentage of certain intrinsics.
* Percentage gained is based on the weight of the corpse; minimum being 5% and maximum at 50% (capped at 100%).
* Tins convey the same percentage from whatever they are made from.
* You will always get a percentage intrinsic from each corpse eaten.
* You receive all intrinsics that the corpse can convey if there are multiple intrinsics it can give (ie: eating a black pudding corpse grants a small percentage each of poison, cold, and shock resistance.)
* Damage/effects dealt felt are adjusted based on the percentage intrinsic currently possessed. Damage reduction is rounded down, requiring slightly more resistance to be effective.
* Gremlins steal (25 + d25)% of your intrinsics
* Cold traps and ice demons also steal (25 + d25)% of your cold resistance.
* Enlightenment always shows the partial percentage acquired for intrinsics. If you have an extrinsic source that will be displayed separately.

### Partial Reflection
* Ported from EvilHack
* Reflection will deflect most, but not all, of the effects of ray attacks.
  * Example: You are hit by a cold ray, it reflects off your amulet of reflection, but you don't yet possess cold resistance.
* If you don't have sleep resistance, but you reflect a sleep ray, you will fall asleep for 1d6 turns (which could be lessened by your current level of sleep resistance).
* If you reflect disintegration ray, you still take 12d6 damage (subject to your current level of disintegration resistance).
* If you reflect a death ray, you still take damage and lose max HP. This can be mitigated by magic resistance and half-spell damage, but is impossible to fully prevent.
* Item destruction from elemental effects (like fire or cold) is prevented when rays are reflected.
* Reflection only provides partial protection from **floating eye gazes** - the player will still be subject to d2 turns of paralysis without free action. This is weighted on Luck, so the higher your Luck the better the chance to avoid the gaze.
* **Medusa's gaze** has no effect on her if reflected back from more than 3 squares away.
  * If she might be affected by her own gaze, Medusa will protect herself 98% of the time.
* Monsters also have partial reflection, making them more vulnerable to various ray attacks.

### Magic cancellation (MC) protects items vs cancellation
* Any level of MC limits the damage if the enchantment on an item is positive.
* If the enchantment is negative, the item's enchantment is cancelled to +0 as usual.
* If it's a potion, scroll, or other item that would be blanked, it also gets an additional save roll.
* With MC0, there is no protection when facing a cancel zap and the standard NetHack 3.7.0 rules apply.

Each level of MC offers a higher minimum that you should expect to maintain. This minimum is not absolute however, there is an additional role (1 in MCx2) to determine if some damage will pass through.
* MC1: Item enchantments will not usually go below +2
* MC2: Item enchantments will not usually go below +4
* MC3: Item enchantments will not usually go below +6

* MC1: Items have a 1 in 2 chance to avoid blanking
* MC2: Items have a 2 in 3 chance to avoid blanking
* MC3: Items have a 5 in 6 chance to avoid blanking

### Gaze attack protection
* Displacement protects from gaze attacks, only letting 1 in 11 gaze attacks find the player
* Invisibility protects from gaze attacks, only letting 1 in 11 gaze attacks find the player
* Darkness offers protection from gaze attacks (as long as the player is on a dark square and the gazer doesn't have infravision and the player is infravisible).
* If a gazer is in melee range, it will bypass invisibility and darkness protection.
* Hallucination always protects against floating eye gaze.
* Hallucination negates all incoming gaze attacks, except Medusa's glare (xnh).

### Slow digestion nerf
* Slow digestion now functions in a fashion opposite of the ring of hunger.
* Slow digestion only prevents hunger for 1 in every 2 turns
* The previous Vanilla behavior slowed hunger to only occur 1 in 20 turns

### Stealth changes
* To bring back the feeling of the 3.4.3 **stealth** mechanic, the chance of sleeping monsters waking up and growling has been lowered dramatically and is based on luck.
  * 0 Luck: 12.5% chance of a monster screaming when roused.
  * 2+ Luck: 0.3% chance
  * Negative luck has at least a 30% chance of rousing monsters.

### Flying Changes
* You cannot be Fast or Very Fast while levitating.
* You cannot be Very Fast while flying.
* Stomping boots and Jumping boots block flying.
* Extrinsic fumbling blocks flying (from boots or gloves)
* You cannot jump while flying.
* Items that grant **steadfastness** will do so even if the hero is flying or levitating.

### Aggravate Monster changes
* Cannibalism causes aggravation for 10-15k turns instead of permanently.
* Eating domestic animals causes aggravation for 5000-7500 turns instead of permanently.
* Intrinsic aggravate monster increases monster difficulty by 5 (stacks with extrinsic).
* Aggravate monster spell cast at hero causes intrinsic aggravation for 50-300 turns.
* Aggravate monster causes monsters not to be scared of musical instruments.
* Having the Aggravate Monster trinsic lets monsters track you.
* Ring of aggravate monster causes pets to attack anything without fear.
* Note: The ring of aggravate monster increases the monster generation difficulty by 15 (this was already implemented in NetHack 3.7, but it's worth including here as a recent change)
* Carrying foulstones also confers aggravate monster

### Impaired Actions
* Allow #terrain whilst impaired (xnh)
* Falling downstairs does more damage: 10-19 instead of 1d3. (K-Mod with higher damage)
* Falling down a hole or pit whilst fumbling (or low dex) can make you fall on a wielded weapon.
* Going downstairs whilst stunned always results in falling, confusion sometimes does.
* Don't allow stunned jumping. Confused jumping has a 20% chance to fail (Evil)
* Many item actions are now forbidden if you have both hands welded.
* If you (or a monster) are stuck in a pit, the range of wand zaps and thrown items is limited to the  squares adjacent to the pit.
* Hallucination affects all item descriptions and appearances in and outside of your inventory (SLASHEM)
* Auto-pickup is automatically disabled whilst hallucinating.
* You will always hit monsters who are holding you.
* No multishot when **fumbling**

## MECHANICS CHANGES

### Instakills
* It is no longer possible to be insta-petrified by touching footrice or their corpses.
* Bardiches are a new, but rare, source of insta-death. They have a 1 in 100 chance of beheading a monster or you on hit.
* Magic resistance and half-spell damage offers some protection from self-zapped wands of death (or the finger of death spell).

### Wishing
* The wand of wishing in the Castle has been removed. Instead, there are guaranteed scrolls of wishing located at the Castle, Vlad's Tower, The Wizard's Tower, and Moloch's Sanctum.
* Wands of wishing and scrolls of wishing do not generate randomly.
* Quest artifacts cannot be wished for (dnh)
* Attempting to wish for quest artifacts doesn't use up a wish
* Wishes no longer increase prayer timeout (Dyna)
* Wishes from thrones are much more rare. The chance of getting a wish from sitting on a throne is now about 1.5%. Whenever a player hits the 1 in 13 chance to get a wish and they don't, they lose 1 point of Luck (this roughly translates to a 6% chance of losing luck anytime you sit on a throne). Once the player is granted a wish from a throne, the throne is guaranteed to disappear. (Evil with adjustments)f
* Players have a chance of getting a wish from crowning now (if no intrinsics were granted).
* Artiwishes only care about previous **successful** artiwishes.
* Wishing with bad luck causes amnesia.
* Diluted smoky potions no longer can spawn djinnis
* The odds for fountain wishes has been inverted: they are more likely *the deeper* you are instead of the closer you are to the dungeon entry.

There are a few new sources of wishes:
* Using the Deck of Fate can result in a wish if you draw The World card. The deck is then used up.
* If you zap a wand of wonder and get the wand of wishing effect (and pass a 1 in 100 roll), you can get a wish. The odds of getting a wish on any given zap are (1/28) * (1/100) for 1 in 2800 per zap.

**The chance of receiving the artifact from a wish is:**

    1 in [number of previous artifact wishes + 1].

  * Artifact wish #1: 1 in 1 chance of success (100%)
  * Artifact wish #2: 1 in 2 chance of success (50%)
  * Artifact wish #3: 1 in 3 chance of success (33%)
  * And so on.

### Genocide has been nerfed and renamed to Exile
* A renaming was in order because genocide was heavily nerfed and functions differently from vanilla NetHack.
* Permanent dungeon-wide monster genocides are no longer allowed.
* An uncursed scroll of exile works to wipe out a single species of monster that is in close proximity to the player.
* A blessed scroll of exile wipes out a single species on the level.
* All other effects are identical to the scroll of genocide in vanilla.
* Genocides from thrones have been replaced with a generous gift of gold.

### Slow Luck timeouts (modified)
In NerfHack, Luck items greatly slow down Luck timeout rather than stopping it completely - this is similar to how it works in UnNetHack. However, the timeouts have been modified and extended to cover negative base luck situations. The timeouts have also been reduced heavily from the UnNetHack calculations.

The modified Luck timeout depends on how far your Luck is from your base Luck: the higher or lower your Luck, the less the timeout is slowed. The timeout is calculated every turn, meaning gaining or losing a point of Luck could result in that point timing out immediately.

The modified Luck timeout is calculated by the following formula:

    Timeout = 25 * (20 - base_distance) * (20 - base_distance)

base_distance is how far you are from your base luck. If your base luck is 0 and you have 3 Luck, the base_distance is 3. If you have -10 base luck and 10 Luck, the base_distance is 20. The following chart shows how many turns it takes to timeout from one luck level to the next and the total turns to reach the base distance of 0.

| base distance | Timeout | Time to base Luck |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 0             | ∞       | 0                 |
| 1             | 9 025   | 9 025             |
| 2             | 8 100   | 17 125            |
| 3             | 7 225   | 24 350            |
| 4             | 6 400   | 30 750            |
| 5             | 5 625   | 36 375            |
| 6             | 4 900   | 41 275            |
| 7             | 4 225   | 45 500            |
| 8             | 3 600   | 49 100            |
| 9             | 3 025   | 52 125            |
| 10            | 2 500   | 54 625            |
| 11            | 2 025   | 56 650            |
| 12            | 1 600   | 58 250            |
| 13            | 1 225   | 59 475            |
| 14            | 900     | 60 375            |
| 15            | 625     | 61 000            |
| 16            | 400     | 61 400            |
| 17            | 225     | 61 625            |
| 18            | 100     | 61 725            |
| 19            | 25      | 61 750            |
| 20            | 0       | 61 750            |

### Pet behavior
#### Pet Theft
* Pet theft from shops has been totally nerfed.
* Pets will never pick up objects in shops nor eat unpaid food (Gnoll)
* You also cannot #loot items to/from your pet that are unpaid.
* Shopkeepers start with more gold, usually more than double the standard amounts (gnoll)

#### Pets are limited by charisma
* Your maximum number of pets is normally (CHA / 3). If you get more pets than that, they will be untamed starting with the weakest first (Evil)

* Ported from EvilHack with modifications
* The number of pets you can have on a level is now capped at Charisma divided by 3.
* For example, if your charisma is only 7, you can keep 2 pets, at 9 charisma you can keep 3 pets.
* However, if you exceed this limit, your weakest pets (based on level) will be the first to become untamed, with ties resolved randomly.
* Untamed pets that were previously mistreated, such as resurrected ones, may even turn hostile.
* Your steed, whilst counting toward your pet limit, will never become untamed.
* Summoned spell beings do not count toward the total pet limit.
* Since the minimum CHA possible is 3, you should always be capable of retaining a pet.

**Misc pet changes:**
* Steeds are more aggressive - if your steed has a tameness level of 15 or more, it will actively attack monsters instead of merely reacting to being attacked (Evil)
* Chaotics do not get alignment penalties for casting healing at pets (xnh)
* Restrict pets from blowing you up via gas spore, so they won't attack one whilst you are adjacent (xnh)
* Pets never displace player from stairs when entering a level (Dyna).
* Pets' items can be managed with #loot
* We can also see if pets are stunned, confused, or blinded on farlook.
* Pets will use items more intelligently (EvilHack). Many extensions to the pet AI were implemented that help them value armor, weapons, and items so they use the best equipment possible.
* Tame pets will not hide or conceal themselves.

### Polymorphing Objects and Polypiling
* The number of items you have polymorphed can be viewed in #conduct
* Non-magical potions, scrolls, spellbooks, and wands are much less likely to transform into magical items. These items only have a 1% chance of transforming into something magical. This is now comparable to other non-magical items polymorphing into magical. (dnh)
* The chances of getting a golem from polypiling have been increased (K-Mod/Spork)
* The enchantment level or charges can be randomly reduced on polymorphed objects (Spork)
* Golems created from polypiling immediately halt the polypiling process. This effectively nerfs the "one-giant-pile" strategy of polypiling.

### Poly-Self
* Players can use gaze attacks in melee range when polymorphed into monsters with a gaze attack.
* Humanoids are more careful about attacking you when you are a dangerous polyform.
* Mind flayers won't purposely to eat the brains of petrifying monsters (ie: when you are polymorphed into a cockatrice)
* When you polymorph into a 'nolimbs' monster, you are able to slip out of a ball & chain (Evil)
* Escape from controlled polymorph prompt no longer causes random poly (xnh).
* Polymorphing into a horned monster destroys flimsy or cloth helms.
* Being polymorphed into a wandering form will sometimes make you wander.
* Being polyd into a vampire bat doesn't cause stunning.

### Elbereth and Scare Monster
* Conflict negates Elbereth and scare monster protection (Evil)
* Engraving Elbereth no longer exercises wisdom (Fourk).
* You can't dust engrave whilst being held by a monster.
* You can't dust engrave on bloody or grassy tiles.
* You don't waste turns for aborted engrave attempts.

**Reverted 82f0b1e8e**
* The previous behavior implmemented in 3.7.0 was "Scared hostile monster which cannot move away will attack."
* This has been reverted so players will be able to stand on scrolls of scare monster or Elbereth without risk of random melee attacks from scared or fleeing monsters.
* The reason for this is that it violates the classic, expected behavior of Elbereth. There are other nerfs to Elbereth and scare-monster that take the place of this.

### New Grease Effects
Many of these changes were introduced to work in conjunction with the new grease trap.
* Greased items can't be disarmed with a bullwhip
* Greased items are harder to steal
* Glib hands makes applying any item except towels drop them
* Towels can be used to remove grease from specific objects (with the risk that they in turn
  become greased)
* Grease can be washed off towels by wetting them
* Greased towels now operate the same way that cursed towels do
* Grease can be washed off your feet/boots by dipping '-' in water, same action as dipping the player's hands.
* Kicking monsters can sometimes get the grease to wear off your boots/feet.
* Greased gloves cause Glib.
* Greased feet/boots cause fumbling.
* If you try to take off greased boots or any boots while you have greasy feet, you become Glib for a short time.
* Greased rings slip off your fingers as if you had greasy fingers.

### DEMON AND DEMON LAIR CHANGES
* Allow covetous monsters to follow normal AI (xNetHack).
* Demonic bribes are much more expensive.
* Juiblex buffs.
* Geryon buffs (EvilHack).
* Increase speed of Baalzebub.

### Endgame Changes
* Occasional earthquakes can occur during the ascension run (Un/Evil). These will cease after entering the planes.
* After the invocation (and whilst traversing through Gehennom), monsters will flood from the upstairs (Un/Evil)
* The identity of the Riders hidden via farlook (Un)
* The correct temple on the Astral Plane will not be revealed due to fleeing monsters (Un)
* Replaced undead on Astral Plane with random A (xnh).
* Wizard harassment (after initially killing the Wizard of Yendor) has been increased by 20-25%
* Some monsters on the Astral Plane spawn with rings of slow digestion or teleport control to thwart "purple rain" and teleportation strategies.
* Level-teleporting (or branchporting) in hell causes major pain. The levelport will still succeed as normal, but costs a large fraction of the hero's HP and energy. It also drains the max of both (up to 1d3 each). To be fair, the player is warned before this happens and can abort the teleport. This also includes the Wizard's Tower and Vlad's Tower.
* Amulet of Yendor needs only be carried to hint of nearby portals (Spork).
* Allow performing the invocation whilst hallucinating.

### Farming Nerfs

A big philosophy of NerfHack is to discourage repetitive and potentially infinite strategies and exploits. These specific nerfs also are aimed at encouraging using "found items" and prodding the player deeper into the dungeon.

* **Vault guard farming:** Vault guards don't get special offensive or defensive items on spawn and don't leave death drops.
* **Temple ghost farming:** All abandoned temples only spawn one ghost and then lose their status as a temple.
* **Quest monster/giant farming:** This is mostly in regard to what is known as "giant farming" in the valkyrie quest. Players could possibly farm giants for strength and gems by subsisting on their corpses. Monster generation in quests is now dramatically less frequent.
* **Werefoo farming:** Werefoo summon temporary spell-beings that don't leave death drops or corpses.
* **Horn of plenty farming:** Historically, horns of plenty could be endlessly recharged using the tourist's quest artifact, the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. However, this exploit has been nerfed to align with the restrictions on recharging tools, similar to the limitations imposed on wands.
* Trees on special levels are pre-looted. This doesn't fit into the classic "infinite" farming category, but because many levels have been modified to feature copious amounts of trees, a player could farm them all for bees and fruits.

### Underwater mechanics
* Prevent kicking monsters out of water while underwater or vice versa.
* The hero and other monsters resist splash, spore, and fire effects while underwater.
* Being underwater provides immunity from explosions.
* Being underwater prevents fire damage.

## AC nerfs & buffs


### Dexterity affects AC
* Ported from EvilHack
* Being encumbered negates AC bonuses from dexterity
* Wearing any kind of heavy metallic body armor (not mithril) or other rigid material also negates beneficial AC bonuses

| Dexterity | AC change |
| --------- | --------- |
| <= 6      | +3        |
| 7-9       | +1        |
| 10-14     | +0        |
| 15-16     | -1        |
| 17-18     | -2        |
| 19-20     | -3        |
| 21-23     | -4        |
| 24-25     | -5        |

### Encumbrance affects AC
* Being encumbered has a severe negative effect on your AC and inflicts +4AC for each level of encumbrance.

| Encumbrance | AC change |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Burdened    | +4        |
| Stressed    | +8        |
| Strained    | +12       |
| Overtaxed   | +16       |
| Overloaded  | +20       |

* **The "wounded legs" status** also inflicts a severe AC penalty for bearing weight. You get +1AC for every 100aum you are carrying whilst you are wounded. Many traps can cause this condition, but now the jungle boots can be useful to prevent it.


## SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE


### Skill Changes
The skill system for achieving proficiency in weapons and spells has been adapted from the UnNetHack system. In UnNetHack most of the requirements for advancing skills have been substantially increased. The major exception is that training skills from unskilled only takes 50 uses compared to UnNetHack's 100.

This chart shows the number of successful uses of a skill required to reach each level.  These values are:

| Skill level  | Successful uses | Old value |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------- |
| Unskilled    | 0               | 0         |
| Basic        | 50              | 20        |
| Skilled      | 200             | 80        |
| Expert       | 400             | 180       |
| Master       | 800             | 320       |
| Grand Master | 1600            | 500       |

* 1-damage hits train weapon/unarmed skills (Dyna)
* Riding skill is exercised more quickly, closer to vanilla (Un)
* Skill gain for spells is faster than skill gain for weapons (Un)
* Shield skill gains are also quadrupled to keep pace with the increased skill requirements.
* The spellcasting skill bonus no longer applies after you can advance the spell school past basic.
* Training skill in pick-axe affects how fast you can dig (Evil)
    * Skilled gives you the same bonus as a dwarf (x2)
    * Expert gives you double the bonus of a dwarf (x4)

### Shield Skill
* Ported from EvilHack with some modifications
* Shield skill can be trained up like any other weapon attack. It is not actively trained, but passively as you block attacks with your shield. Sometimes you will train even if not directly shielding. There's a 2 in 3 chance of training shield skill whilst wearing one and a regular miss event occurs. A further check is rolled against the enchantment of the shield, with a higher enchantment resulting in more chance of training.
* Different roles can reach different levels of shield skill.
* As a player levels up with shield, there is also a small chance of shield bashing when attacking a monster.

#### Effects at different skill levels:

### Leveling up bonuses
Leveling up grants damage bonuses (SlashTHEM)
    * Level 10, +1 damage to attacks.
    * level 20+: +d(x), where x is 1 damage for every additional level gained.
    * For example: At level 25, you would get a combined total of +d6+1 damage (+1 for reaching XP 10 and +6 for levels 20-25).

### To-hit bonuses and penalties
A lot of changes have been introduced to reign back the bonuses for to-hit because in vanilla NetHack, its not uncommon to have nearly a 100% hit rate by the mid or late game.

* Strength doesn't affect to-hit calculations.
* * The effect Luck has on to-hit bonuses has been reduced to (Luck / 3) (Evil/Spork)
* Luck still has an effect when -1, -2, +1, and +2 (xNetHack)
* Players get an additional +1 to-hit bonus whilst XP1-5.
*Players get a to-hit bonus after reaching level 20 (from EvilHack with adjustments)
    * Level 22: +1 to-hit
    * Level 24: +d2 to-hit
    * Level 26: +d3 to-hit, and so on.
* Weapon enchantments give variable to-hit bonus instead of flat bonus.
* The enchantment based to-hit bonus for projectiles capped at +7.
* All short swords get +1 to-hit (Dyna)
* You get a +4 to-hit bonus for attacking with a scimitar on a steed.
* **Polearms** get a +4 to-hit bonus vs horses and centaurs.
* fencing gloves provide +2 to-hit when you are attacking with a free off-hand (dnh)
* gauntlets of dexterity grant +1 to-hit whilst using bows (Evil)
* gauntlets of fumbling grant -9 to-hit penalty whilst using bows (Evil)
* combat boots provide 1AC and +1 to-hit (dnh)
* You have an increaseed wand to-hit chance for high-dex characters  (Splice)


## MISC CHANGES


* These don't really fit into any category, or are just silly.
* 8d93bedd9 Halu reverse geno troll msg (UnNetHack).
* 899833966 Funny troll #chat messages (SpliceHack).
* Characters who don't like baths may resist fountain's urging (xnh).
* New hallucinatory monsters from Secret of Mana and Magic of Scheherazade.
* The fat lady sings if you win whilst hallucinating (xnh).

Many thanks to all the folks who have helped out with the original Hack'EM and NerfHack, contributing ideas, making patches, playtesting, or anything!


### Changes that were later adopted into NetHack 3.7.0
* Archeologists get a luck bonus for wearing a fedora (Un).
* Improved item destruction (xnh). This patch fixes some problems with item destruction, making it less random and more dependent on the damage dealt in the interaction. Overall, players should expect to get a more fair deal with fewer items destroyed.
