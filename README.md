## ITEM CHANGES


* **Items that are 'lost'** from the players inventory will no longer be un-identified.
* Items that grant **steadfastness** will do so even if the hero is flying or levitating.
* Levels of erosion on an object can affect its price (Evil).
* orcish equipment usually generates rusty and/or corroded
* dwarven items frequently spawn as fixed.
* Towels cannot be worn. Blindfolds now must be relied upon for blinding.

### Price Identification Nerf
This change destroys price identification and aligns most potions, scrolls, wands, and rings to the same price (SLEX).

* All rings cost $200
* All potions cost $200
* All wands cost $200
* All scrolls cost $200

Exceptions:
* Potions of water still cost 100 (if cursed or blessed)
* Potions of blood cost 100
* Cards of zapping still cost $50. These are usually only present for cartomancers.

### ITEM EROSION AND DESTRUCTION
* Objects can be completely destroyed via rusting/rotting/corroding (Evil)
* Almost all items are erodeable/destroyable (Evil) - amulets, rings, wands, and tools are now eligible for erosion. These items can be erodeproofed via confused enchant weapon scrolls or by dipping into potions of reflection.
* Silver items can corrode (xnh)
* The iron ball and chain cannot be destroyed from rusting (Evil)
* Poison gas clouds can rot organic armor
* Monsters can wear down and destroy **ANY** armor with the destroy armor spell (Evil)
* Item erosion can be repaired by dipping into a potion of restore ability (xnh)
* Scrolls can burn up when hitting hot ground in Gehennom. (3.7 introduced potions being shattered when dropping on hot ground - this just takes it a step further.
* Getting hit by potions of acid can corrode armor. Monster acid attacks and spit also corrode armor.
* Passive acid attacks corrodes armor more often.
* Thrown potions of acid can corrode items when they hit a monster or the player.
* Water damage may disintegrate scrolls; may occur when dipping (Dyna)
* Disintegration rays can vaporize boulders
* Improved item destruction (xnh). This patch fixes some problems with item destruction, making it less random and more dependent on the damage dealt in the interaction. Overall, players should expect to get a more fair deal with fewer items destroyed.

### Anti-magical items resist being enchanted (from SpliceHack)
* If an item grants magic resistance, it will resist scrolls of enchant weapon and enchant armor.
* The resistance is not absolute.
* If the item's current enchantment is negative, it will always accept the enchantment.
* If the item is +0 or greater, the chance of success for an enchantment effect is 1 in (n + 2), where n is the current enchantment.
* Gray dragon scales can always be converted to dragon scale mail.

### Weapon changes
#### Higher max weapon enchantment
* Weapons can be enchanted much higher, with a soft limit of +11.
* This means that the new "+5" is "+11", and +13 is easily attainable by reading a blessed scroll of enchant weapon with a +11 weapon.
* To compensate, weapon enchantment gives variable to-hit bonus instead of flat bonus. This means that instead of a +7 weapon granting +7 to-hit, it grants a random to-hit bonus from 0 to +7.
* Random weapons have a small chance to generate with very high enchantment.
* The enchantment based to-hit bonus for projectiles capped at +7.
* Thrown projectiles above +7 have a high chance of dulling on hit. Even though projectiles can be enchanted quite high to +11, +12, or +13, they will quickly diminish to +7.
* Lords, princes, and uniques will also appear with much higher enchantment on their weapons.
* Beware, over-enchanted weapons that vaporize now explode.
* Abuse wisdom if items are destroyed by over-enchanting.

#### Misc weapon changes
* Swapping weapons take 0 turns (dnh)
* A welded cursed quarterstaff doesn't block spellcasting (xnh)
* Cursed launchers always have a chance of misfiring.
* Cursed projectiles can hit yourself in the leg (Evil).
* Crysknives are never auto-quivered
* Any slashing or piercing weapons can now be poisoned (SLASHEM)
* All short swords get +1 to-hit (Dyna)
* Reduced probability of long swords generating (K-Mod)
* Increased probability of boomerangs
* Increased weight of war hammers to 120.
* Reduced weight of morning star to 50.
* Reduced weight of bullwhips to 7 aum
* Increased weight of shuriken to 2 aum each.
* Wielded polearms grant an AC bonus depending on their weight (for every 30aum, they grant -1AC)
* **Spears** at expert skill can skewer through enemies, allowing you to hit the enemy directly behind the target. Peacefuls are prevented from being hit unless the spear is cursed. We also won't auto-skewer the spot unless it is visible or spottable via ESP. Skewering doesn't trigger most passive attacks unless it's a passive electrifying attack and you attack with a metal spear.
* **Tridents** at skilled can also skewer monsters.
* **Spetums** can skewer up to 3 monsters when used in melee whilst riding a steed
* **Ranseurs** can disarm monsters or the player when pounded or used in melee whilst riding a steed.
* **Bardiches (long poleaxes)** have a 1 in 100 chance of beheading monsters (or the player)
* +4 to-hit bonus for attacking with a scimitar on a steed.
* Wielding and unwielding **curved swords** takes 0 turns.
* **Morning stars and flails** can stun monsters (or the player) on critical hits. Player must be skilled or better.
* Special weapon effects (like rogue backstab, flail stunning, and samurai katana weapon smashing) have been enabled when two-weaponing.
* **Crossbows** no longer grant multishot, instead their damage output is multiplied by your skill (dnh)
* No multishot when **fumbling**
* **Boomerangs** will can pass through enemies on hit.
* **Polearms** can be used to trigger traps (from NetHack Fourk).
* **Polearms and lances** can be pounded when blind (as long as you can sense the target)
* **Daggers and knives** have a small chance to mulch. If non-cursed, the probability is 1 in 100. If cursed, they go through the same checks as other mulchable projectiles.

#### War Hammers
* war hammers have been changed from a one-handed weapon into a competitive two-handed weapon (xnh)
* They now deal 2d6 vs small monsters and 2d8 vs large

#### Slings
* Projectiles receive a strength bonus when using slings (xnh). However, this bonus is 3/4'th what is normally granted.
* Gem class projectiles do minimal damage vs thick-skinned monsters
* Launching gem class projectiles from slings has the potential to instakill H

### Armor changes
* reduced weight of most armors by 50 aum (K-Mod)
* reduced weight of elven gear by about 1/3'rd (Evil)
* kicking boots supersede thick_skin/clumsy (Splice)
* mud boots provide protection from wrapping attacks

* increased weight of dwarvish and elven mithril coats to 200 aum
* increased weight of dragon scales and scale mail to 80 aum
* mummy wrappings always generate rotted
* cursed armor weighs more when worn.
* **the protective effect of hard helmets** has been reduced when heavy objects fall on the hero's head.
* only elves can safely enchant elven armor over +3. Other races will get a warning vibration if their elven armor is enchanted over +3.
* worn armor has a 25% weight reduction (xnh/FIQ)
* dwarves and elves get a +1 bonus for each racially aligned piece of armor they wear (Evil)
* orcs and gnomes get a +2 bonus for each racially aligned piece of armor they wear (Evil/THEM)
* plate mail now grants 8AC
* crystal plate mail now grants 9AC
* bronze plate mail now grants 7AC
* leather armors don't grant any MC.

#### Dragon scales and scale mail changes
* The AC of dragon scales has been reduced from 3AC to 1AC
* The AC of dragon scale mail has been reduced from 9AC to 4AC
* Dragon scale mail weighs 80.
* **Dragon scale mail cannot be wished for**
* Any wishes for scale mails will simply be converted to the equivalent dragon scales instead. For example, if you wish for "yellow dragon scale mail", you will receive "yellow dragon scales".
* When wishing for dragon scales, any specified enchantment is nullified to +0 (xnh)
* Dragon scales do not provide secondary intrinsics, they must be enchanted into scale-mail for the secondary effect to kick in.
* Green dragon scale mail also grants regeneration.
* White dragon scale mail confers water walking (EvilHack).
* Red dragon scale mail confers increase damage; enchantment works in the same fashion as a ring of increase damage.
* Silver dragon scale mail offers protection against most blinding attacks.
* Silver dragon scales and scale mail are actually coated in silver (Splice)
* Shimmering dragon scales convey displacement; the scale-mail also conveys stun resistance. The scales also provide -2AC and the scale-mail provides -5AC.

### Comestibles

* Blessed food items are rotten much less often.
* Eucalyptus leaves can never be rotten unless cursed.
* Zapping eggs with cancellation sterilizes them (from HackEM).
* Cursed food items will no longer tame or pacify monsters.
* Recolor royal jelly to magenta (EvilHack/xNetHack).
* Nutrition tweaks and messages for lembas and cram (Evil)
### Potions
* Potions can shatter when dropped on cold floor (this shows up in Sokoban and in Gehennom)
* Implement behavior for cursed potion of gain ability (xnh)
* Vampires like cursed blood more than uncursed or blessed blood (the opposite of SLASH'EM)
* Cursed potions of gain level can be used in Sokoban to bypass a floor (xnh)
* Dipping an eroded item in restore ability repairs the erosion (xnh)

* Dipping a unicorn horn into a potion of acid will dissolve the horn, alchemizing it into a potion of healing.
* Dipping scrolls of amnesia blanks non-water non-polymorph potions.
* HP gains from healing potions are subject to nurse dancing limits, but the limit is always observed as if the players level is maxed out at 30.

#### Diluted potion effects
* Most potions have a much less potent effect when diluted (EvilHack)
* Potions can sometimes generate diluted.
* Shopkeepers only offer 1/2 price for diluted potions.
* Diluted healing potions heal less and grant less max-HP (EvilHack).

#### GEM ALCHEMY
* Ported from UnNetHack, originally from SLASH'EM.
* This allows you to dip a gem into a potion of acid, to alchemize a potion with a specific appearance.
* This adds some serious value to potions of acid and gems.
* Gem alchemy recipes can be viewed in the object lookup entry for "potion of acid".
* Other potions and gems should display their respective recipes.
* Gems auto-id after successful gem alchemy.

### Scrolls
* Reduced probability of enchant weapon scrolls, increased prob of scrolls of knowledge.
* Blank scrolls cost 50
* Buff the effects of the scroll of light (xnh)
* Reverse the name of the HACKEM MUCHE scroll
* Cursed scrolls of remove curse will curse items.
* Scrolls of genocide only clear a single monster species on the level (uncursed) or globally (blessed) (Un)
* Endgame genocide nerf. Monsters cannot be fully genocided after entering the planes. Any genocides executed in the end game will be uncursed and only have a 1 in 4 chance of destroying each monster of that species. This is a soft counter to the plane of water genocide strategy that most players employ. Players can still genocide ; before entering the planes, but beware, there might be more dangerous replacements waiting for them.
* Enchant armor: Ability to choose worn piece of armor to enchant/repair (Evil)
* Give enchanting vibrate warning for all weapons/armor (Dyna)
* Blessed scroll of destroy armor asks which armor to destroy (xnh)
* Confused cursed scroll of destroy armor prompts for armor to fix
* Confused scroll of identify gives enlightenment (xnh)
* Confused cursed scroll of punishment decreases god anger by 1.

### Wands
* Cursed wands have a higher chance of exploding and can backfire.
* Raise odds of a cursed wand exploding to 1 in 30 (Un)
* Cursed wand backfire patch (Evil)
  * If a directional wand is cursed and the player zaps it, there's a 1 in 8 chance it will backfire, hitting the player instead.
* Blessed and uncursed wands wrest much more often
  * blessed wands wrest 1/7 of the time
  * uncursed wrest 1/23 of the time
  * cursed wands still wrest 1/121 of the time
* Wand of cancellation extensions
  * Monsters can zap the player with wands of cancellation
  * Being cancelled removes the protection spell effects
  * Small chance dragon scale mail will revert back to a set of scales if cancelled (Un/Evil)
* Increase wand to-hit chance for high-dex characters  (Splice)
* Wands of secret door detection can be broken to detect traps.
* Wand explosions discharge their effects in an explosion (SLASH'EM).
* Monsters zapping cursed wands have double the chance of explosions.
* You must have at least one free hand to zap a wand.
* Plastic wands can neither be broken (via apply) nor exploded by shock damage.

#### Wands of wishing
* Wands of wishing do not generate randomly.
* The only wand of wishing is found at the castle and is precharged with 2 charges so will always yield 3 wishes, no more and no less.


### Rings/Amulets
* Port FIQHack's ring initial enchantment rules
* Cursed rings burn extra nutrition when worn.
* Amulets of magical breathing are immune to water damage
* The ring of levitation is now a valid starting ring.
* Rings of sustain ability protect legs from wounding.
* Cursed rings can slip off your fingers when Glib.
* Amulets of unchanging can't be polymorphed (Un)
* Amulets of guarding are now chargable with variable AC protection (positive or negative)
* Activating Protection from shape changers wakes up shifters when they revert to their normal shape (this also applies to Werebane, since that also confers PfSC)
* Rings of free action offer protection from grabbing attacks (from SLASH'EM).
* Lower chances of rings exploding during charging (SporkHack). Rings with enchantment +3 or lower will no longer have a chance to explode when charged, and rings at -5 or lower will only explode from cursed charging
* Rings of conflict usually generate cursed.
* Reduced the probability for amulets of reflection.
* We fully identify rings of increase damage or accuracy with enough experience killing monsters.

#### Eating Jewelery & Accessories
* Eating rings and amulets only confers an intrinsic for a temporary period.
*  To compensate for the temporary nature of these intrinsics, the possibility of getting the property is guaranteed.
 * Before, the chance of getting an intrinsic from a ring by eating it was 1 in 3. It is now 100%. The chance for an amulet by eating it was 1 in 5. It has been changed to 100%.

** Summary of revised eating effects:**
 - Eating a ring now grants 750-1500 turns of it's property intrinsically.
 - Eating an amulet now grants 1250-2000 turns of it's property intrinsically.
 - Eating the amulet of reflection now gives intrinsic reflection for 1250-2000 turns. Previously it would not grant anything.
 - Eating the amulet of flying now gives intrinsic flying for 1250-2000 turns. Previously it had no effect.

### Tools
* Reduced weight of land mines to 40 aum (xnh)
* Reduced weight of beartraps to 50 aum (xnh)
* Reduced weight of pick-axe to 75 aum (SLASHEM)
* Increase the prices of many magical tools
* Raised price of magic marker to 500
* Raised price of magic lamp to 500 (xnh)
* Using eroded unlocking tools also has a chance to break.
* Playing eroded musical instruments can break the instrument or fail to play.
* Applying rusty stethoscope is much less effective.
* Stethoscopes don't work on undead or nonliving monsters.
* Rusty tin openers can break.
* Applying a cursed horn of plenty causes hunger.
* Using a cursed unlocking tool has a chance to break (Evil)
* Credit cards may slip through a lock when cursed or hero is fumbling (xnh).
* Reduce crystal ball paralysis if player has free action (Dyna)
* saddles are now twice as common (FIQ)
* Switch probabilities of bags of holding vs oilskin sacks so BoH are more rare.

#### Safer bags of holding:
The following safeguards were added to protect players from exploding bags:
* Players cannot put **known** wands of cancellation or magical bags into **identified** bags of holding. Keep in mind, unknown wands and bags are still dangerous and should be handled with care until formally identified (dnh)
* Players are prevented from tipping **known** explosive items into **identified** bags of holding
* Empty wands of cancellation may still be placed inside bags of holding (no risk of blowing up)

DISCLAIMER: Bag of holding explosions are not prevented when confused or hallucinating!

#### Magic markers
* Appear randomly much less often (1/5'th of the frequency in Vanilla)
* They can still be creating from polypiling
* There is a 1 in 4 chance of a magic marker being the Sokoban prize.

#### Unicorn horns
* Unicorn horns are now one-handed, dealing d6 vs small/d7 vs large
* Cancelled unicorn horns become degraded, unusable for curing. A unihorn only becomes degraded if it's enchantment is +0, otherwise it is drained of 1 enchantment level.
* Unicorn horn drops decrease as the number of unicorns killed increased.
* Since they are much more rare, be more careful when dipping into random potions as potions of acid will dissolve your unihorn!
* Unicorn horns cannot be poisoned (via toilet dipping)

**Unicorn horns now reduce the timeouts of most afflications instead of outright curing.**
* For troubles that time out (not illness or vomiting), the unihorn has been nerfed so that it only reduces the timeout.
* The amount reduced depends on a few factors:
  * the base fix is 1d3 + 1
  * your skill in unicorn horn (multiplied by 2)
  * the enchantment on your unicorn horn (multiplied by 3)
  * if you are a healer, double the entire above sum
  * Add all of the following for the time out reduction roll (or "troll").
  * For each afflication, we roll d(troll) for the amount reduced.
* Applying a unihorn can also exercise your unihorn skill.

Note: The success rate change from SLASH'EM was experimented with, but ultimately discarded in favor of the timeout nerf.

### Gems/Stones/Rocks
* Reduced weight of flint stones to 2 aum (xnh/Spork)
* Reduced base cost of flint stones to 1.
* Reduced weight of rocks to 4 aum
* Increased weight of all gray stones (except load and flint) to 25.
* Rocks can be broken (a)pplied to produce flint stones (xnh). When the player breaks rocks, they enter into an occupation which continues until the rocks are used up.
* Flint stones can be struck (applied) against objects made of iron, producing sparks (fire). This can scare certain monsters away who fear fire. (Spork/THEM)
* Boulders deal 1+5d4 damage instead of 1d20.
* Cursed gems count as attacks when thrown at unicorns.
* Significantly lowered the odds of luckstones generating randomly; increased the odds of other gray stones

* Potions of reflection are immune to fire and cold damage.
* (!) fingerless gloves do not protect against petrification!

**playing card deck:**
* When applied, gives you a poker hand which correlates to your luck.
* If the deck is blessed (or you are a cartomancer), you get a clear indication of your luck
  by using the kicker.
* If uncursed, you get a rough indication of your luck by the hand strength.
* If cursed, the meanings are reversed.
* Can be #tipped and emptied for a stack of razor cards

**scroll of cloning:**
* Ported from SpliceHack with modifications
* This is a $300 scroll that can clone an item in your inventory or clone yourself if read whilst confused.
* Attempting to clone unique items or items that are too powerful will result in lesser quality results: magic markers, magic lamps, wands of wishing, scrolls of cloning, artifacts, and any invocation items.
* To copy the enchantment on an item, the scroll must be blessed.
* If the scroll is cursed, the resulting item will be cursed.
* All other properties on the item should be copied exactly as is. This enables fun tricks like cloning a +13 fixed crysknife, or that blessed figurine of an Archon you've been holding onto.
* When confused, the scroll clones the player. The resulting clone will have no inventory. A blessed scroll creates a tame clone, an uncursed scroll makes a peaceful clone, and a cursed scroll makes a hostile clone. An interesting side-effect of this is that cloning yourself reduces your current HP by half.
* If confused and the scroll is blessed, you can also clone yourself to create a powerful tame pet if you currently hold a strong polyform (ie: master mind flayer, purple worm, etc)

**Here are the updated features from SpliceHack:**

Unpaid items cloned in shops now become the property of the shopkeeper. Additionally, more item properties are carried over during cloning, including erosion-proofing, container status, and other miscellaneous attributes to ensure that items are genuinely cloned.

Intelligent monsters can also use these scrolls to clone themselves, which helps balance the scroll's power, as many will be consumed by monsters. When monsters read the scrolls, they always read-as-confused, meaning they can only clone themselves. Whilst this approach might seem odd, it simplifies the system by avoiding the complexities of allowing monsters to clone items.

Unique monsters can use these scrolls as well, but the Wizard of Yendor must still follow the Double Trouble routine, ensuring that no more than two Rodneys can oppose you at any time. However, other unique monsters have the potential to clone themselves more than once if the opportunity arises.

**deck of fate:**
This tarot-based deck is very powerful and was ported from SpliceHack with some major changes. In Splice, you would be prompted for how many cards to draw. This has been changed to be a mandatory draw of 5 cards, eliminating the prompt. After using the deck, its always destroyed, allowing only one use. There are 22 different cards in the deck, each having a potentially good or bad effect. About half the cards are "good" and half "bad". There is a nudge factor that occurs if the deck is cursed or blessed.

If cursed, the drawn card will be lowered by one notch. This means The World is impossible to draw with a cursed deck since it's the highest numbered card at 22. It also doubles the chance of drawing The Tower since that card is number 1.

If blessed, the drawn card is raised by one notch. This effectively doubles your chances of drawing The World and prevents The Tower from being drawn.

Grants random effects when you draw a card from it. When you apply it, you are prompted for
how many cards to draw. You can draw a max of 5 cards.

* Can be #tipped and emptied for a stack of random razor cards

This powerful tarot-based deck has been ported from SpliceHack, incorporating some significant changes. In the original version, players were prompted to choose how many cards to draw, but this has now been modified to require a mandatory draw of five cards, eliminating the prompt altogether. After using the deck, it is always destroyed, allowing for only one use. The deck contains 22 different cards, each with the potential for either beneficial or detrimental effects, with approximately half categorized as "good" and half as "bad." Additionally, a nudge factor comes into play depending on whether the deck is cursed or blessed.

When the deck is cursed, the drawn card will be lowered by one notch, making it impossible to draw The World, as it is the highest numbered card at 22. Conversely, this increases the likelihood of drawing The Tower, which is card number 1. If the deck is blessed, the drawn card is raised by one notch, effectively doubling the chances of drawing The World whilst preventing The Tower from being drawn.

Players can can also #tip the deck, emptying it for a stack of random razor cards.

* xorns have flanking
* yellow and black light explosions are directionless (xnh)
* yellow molds puff out clouds of stunning spores (as a corollary, pets will attack them less often now)

### Dangerous piercers
* All piercers are mindless and can grow up
* Much more AC is required to dodge dropping piercers (previously, -2AC would nullify their drop attacks, now -22AC is required)
* Piercing damage scales with their level (monster level * 6) with a minimum of 4d6 being dealt.
* Piercers actually pierce helmets; if the damage roll is (12 + (helmet enchantment * 6) or greater, any hard helmet blocking the attack is destroyed whilst absorbing the damage.
* Piercers and lurkers/trappers always generate hidden if possible.
* Hidden piercers (and other ceiling clingers) can surprise attack you from adjacent squares.

### Reviving and Poisonous Zombies
* Zombie corpses may auto-revive similar to trolls (Evil/xnh)
* Cancelled or beheaded zombies/trolls don't revive (Evil)
* Wielding Sunsword prevents zombies corpses from appearing (Evil)
* Playing as a priest reduces the chance of zombie revival by 50% (Dyna)
* All zombies get an additional poisonous bite attack that can drain constitution.
* Sometimes zombies will try to bite the players legs, inflicting wounded legs for a short time.

### Dragons
* Dragons have been overhauled to more closely resemble the versions in SLASH'EM and FIQHack.
* An attempt has been made to make each dragon have a special quality or perk.
* Part of the challenge in SLASH'EM was that adult dragons (and therefore dragon scales) were more difficult to come by. Baby dragons are plentiful and can potentially be tamed and grown up into adults, but with the large gap in levels the process is long and difficult. It's possible they might not be guaranteed in Ludios or the Castle anymore either, but the increased frequency means they should show up in Gehennom much more often.

#### Baby dragon changes
* Most baby dragons are level 4 and difficulty 6 (SLASHEM)
* Their size has been reduced from HUGE to LARGE (eliminates possible knockback on the player)
* Reduced their weight from 1500 to 1000.
* They can generate randomly in the dungeon with a frequency of 1, but not in Gehennom
* Baby dragons get a special 1d6 bite attack instead of a 2d6 physical bite (K-Mod).

* All baby dragons get an additional 1d6 claw attack
* baby dragon alignments match their adult counterparts (Evil)
* baby red dragons can berserk
* baby blue dragons are slightly faster at speed 12
* baby green dragons regenerate, and are slightly higher level and difficulty
* baby yellow dragons get a passive acid attack
* baby gray dragons flank
* baby white dragons are weaker
* baby gray dragons get a disenchanting bite
* baby black dragons get a drain life attack (and level 7 difficulty)

#### Adult dragon changes
* They get a 3d8 bite and 2d4 claw attacks, and are frequency 2.
* Their speed has been increased from 12 to 20, and have a small buff to their claw attacks (FIQ)
* all dragons stalk/follow the player (FIQ)
* red dragons can berserk
* blue dragons are faster (speed 24)
* green dragons regenerate and are slightly higher level
* orange dragons get a engulf digestion attack
* black dragons get a terrifying roar
* yellow dragons get a passive acid splash attack
* white dragons are weaker than other dragons
* gray dragons can flank
* shimmering dragons have displacement and resist stunning

### Unique monster changes

* She goes from level 20 to 24
* She gets -8AC (a big buff from 2AC)
* Her weapon attack goes from 2d4 to 4d4
* Instead of a single poisonous bite, she gets two poisonous snake bite attacks.
* Medusa also gets a stoning bite (EvilHack).
* Medusa gets infravision

#### Cerberus
* Cerberus has been un-deferred and enabled with many tweaks. It acts as the end boss for the Lethe level.
* Cerberus inherits many abilities from EvilHack:
  - Level raised from 12 to 27
  - Speed raised from 10 to 20
  - AC raised from 2 to -7
  - MR raised from 20 to 90
  - Weight and nutrition raised
  - Size raised from large to huge
  - Added thick skin, berserk, poisonous corpse, see invisible, teleport control, accurate, displaces monsters.

* Some monsters will not throw a weapon that is usable for melee.

### Monster accessory use
* Adapted from EvilHack with modifications
* Monsters can wear most rings and amulets.
* Your pets can also wear the same items, but you need to #loot them and manually give them the gear you want them to equip.
* The range of usable items has been expanded upon, notably:
  * All resistance rings
  * rings of teleportation and teleport control
  * amulets and boots of flying
  * stomping boots
  * amulets versus poison
  * amulets of ESP
  * rings of polymorph (turns any monster into a shapeshifter!)

### Misc monster behavior changes
* Monsters with a negative AC get damage reduction from melee attacks (Evil)
* Monsters will switch to their melee attack intelligently (Spork)
* When a monster spawns with a weapon, it wields it immediately (xnh)
* Intelligent monsters pick up keys and lock picks (Un)
* Magic-liking monsters will pick up magical tools (xnh)
* Covetous monsters will equip wearable items that they target (xnh)
* Monsters will use ranged combat in melee as a fallback option (Grunt)

* Cancelled monsters can't explode (in death or as an attack).
* Displacing monsters (like the displacer beast) cannot displace you if helpless or trapped.
* Cancelled displacers are incapable of displacement.
* Because see invisible cannot be gained intrinsically - peaceful monsters will not make themselves invisible by means of potions, wands, or spells.
* Monsters can hide under other dungeon furniture (xnh)

### Flanking behavior
* Ported from SpliceHack, with enhancements
* Monsters with this property have the M2_FLANK tag.
* Any two monsters can flank a player (or another monster) if they sandwich the target. However, monsters with this property ("outflankers") are more tactical and will actively seek opportunities to flank you.
* Monsters gain a large to-hit bonus when flanking
* Flanking now scales with monster level (it used to be a flat +4 AC penalty in SpliceHack):
* Monsters that are natural outflankers get a much higher bonus than other monsters.
* Flanking has been applied to many monsters in NerfHack.

* Using a pet, you can also take advantage of flanking. Simply place yourself and your pet in such a way as to "sandwich" the monster. You (or your pet) will get a flanking bonus on the victim when attacking.

Flanking restrictions:
* You cannot flank if hallucinating, afraid, confused, punished, fumbling, wounded, unaware, stunned, or standing on an Elbereth engraving.
* You must be able to see the monster you want to flank.
* Monsters cannot flank if eating, sleeping, fleeing, confused, stunned, trapped, petrified, sick, diseased, stationary, or hiding.

Certain roles also count as natural flankers and will get higher bonuses than other roles:
  - Knights
  - Monks
  - Rangers
  - Rogues
  - Samurai
  - Valkyries

### Berserking behavior
* Ported from EvilHack, with modifications
* Monsters with this property have the M3_BERSERK tag and can be quite dangerous if you take them for granted
* When berserkers are below 50% of their health, they have a high chance to go into berserk mode
* Monsters can also immediately go berserk if they are woken and angered
* When a monster goes berserk it turns hostile and regains a roll of it's max HP, possibly
  recovering all of its HP.
* Nearby denizens are also woken up when a monster goes berserk (it screams in anger)
* When berserking, monsters totally ignore Elbereth or Scare Monster. If they are usually skittish or trying to keep away, they will instead actively approach
* Berserking monsters also never flee when their HP gets low
* A berserking monster deals double damage rolls when hitting you
* Taming berserking monsters only un-berserks them, it doesn't pacify or tame
* Monsters that can berserk: all dwarves, mordor orcs, uruk-hai, mumaks, zruty, fire giants, frost giants, storm giants, ettin, all ogres, owlbears, sasquatch, and balrog.
* Berserkers get angry when stuck in traps.

### Rabid monsters
This is a brand new mechanic, debuting in NerfHack!

* There is a fairly small probability of a monster spawning rabid, but bats and coyotes always have a 1 in 10 chance of spawning infected.
* Rabid is mostly limited to living mammals. Insects, birds, and lizards cannot contract it.
* For special rooms (zoos, throne rooms, etc), rabid monsters are prevented from spawning.

Effects of the rabid status on monsters:
* Rabid monsters get an additional bite that can cause the player to become rabid. This bite attack is also poisonous (damaging CON), similar to the rabid rat.
* Rabid monsters don't regenerate
* They grudge all non-rabid monsters (that are capable of catching rabies).
* They occasionally move erratically (from confusion)
* They will never flee or become scared and will actively approach.
* Rabid monsters cannot quaff potions.
* Rabid monsters cannot be tamed.
* If a tame pet becomes rabid, it immediately loses its tameness and becomes hostile.
* Rabid monsters grant a little extra XP when killed.
* Rabid humanoids will growl when #chatted with.

Effect of being rabid on the player:
* You cannot regenerate
* You become bloodthirsty in your attacks (similar to wielding Stormbringer).
* You occasionally move erratically - 1 in 10 moves is confused.
* When the player is infected a timer starts from 100 + d(CON*2) turns.
  * At 40 turns, you develop a fear of water and cannot quaff potions.
  * At 10 turns, you become confused.
  * At 0 turns, you die.

Curing rabid:
* Generally the same guidelines for illness apply, but there are a couple important differences to know about.
* **You cannot use a unicorn horn to heal rabid status!**
* You can drink healing potions (in the early stages)
* You can cast cure illness
* You can pray (counts as a major trouble)
* You can eat a eucalyptus leaf or a clove of garlic
* You can eat the corpse of a dog (tinned or otherwise)
* You can be healed and cured by a nurse
* You can rub a non-cursed foulstone (ie: "madstone").  When the foulstone is used this way, it autocurses and becomes a dangerous item again.
* Rabid monsters that poly can stop being rabid if the new form is immune - the same goes for the player.

### Diseased monsters
* Ported from EvilHack
* Monsters can become infected with terminal illness, with a short countdown to death.
* Monsters can cure themselves if they have the means, and the player can use cure sickness or eucalyptus leaves to heal sick pets.
* Currently the only weapon that causes disease is Grimtooth.

### Accurate behavior
* Ported from EvilHack, with modifications
* Monsters with this property have the M3_ACCURATE tag
* Makes monsters more accurate in melee and with projectiles
* These monsters get a large to-hit bonus of +5 or more
* Players are the elven starting race or polymorphed into elves also enjoy a to-hit bonus that scales with your level.

### Jumping behavior
* Ported from EvilHack/SpliceHack
* Lets monsters jump at you from a few squares away, quickly bridging the gap between you
* They can also cross short barriers like water and lava and even jump over other monsters

### Withering attacks
* Ported from xNetHack and EvilHack
* Withering is a nasty new attack that will give the player the "wither" status temporarily. While withering you will lost 1HP per turn.
* If you are already withering and the new wither attack is strong enough, it will also drain some of your maximum HP, making this threat quite insidious.
* Withering can be cured by quaffing holy water, praying, or invoking the Staff of Aesculapius.
* Any item that grants extrinsic disintegration res also grants withering resistance (black dragon scales, shield of integrity)
* When playing as a vampire, you will also enjoy withering resistance by virtue of being undead.
* All mummies possess wither attacks.
* Powerful clerics can also cast the Blight spell at range which can cause withering.

## MONSTER SPELLCASTING


* Monsters can target and cast spells at other monsters (EvilHack).
* Peaceful monsters won't cast make invisible on themselves. They also won't drink potions
  of invisibility or zap themselves with wands of make invisible.
* Monster spellcasters will prioritize healing when wounded.
* Monster spellcasters can cast stone-to-flesh in response to getting stoned (Evil).
* Don't let monster cleric stunning reset stun counter to 1 when stunned.

### Clerical Spells
#### protection
* Ported from EvilHack
* This is the monster version of the protection spell already available to the player.
* Provides a temporary magical shield that increases the monster's AC protection.
* Can be dissipated with a blast of cancellation.

#### geyser spell
* The core spell is unchanged from Vanilla NetHack, however now the geyser also rusts armor and instakills iron golems (Evil)

#### hobble
* This clerical spell smashes the hero's legs with a magical force and inflicts you with wounded legs for a brief period
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero from up to 13 squares away.

#### blight
* Ported from xNetHack
* In xnh this spell was reserved for 'dark speech' - a nasty group of curses that Asmodeus and Demogorgon can use. But I thought it would be pretty cool if extracted out and used as a new clerical spell. Not too many monsters use clerical spells, but they tend to be potent. The spell itself is pretty straightforward: it inflicts withering on the player. Since withering can only be cured by a few methods, this could end up quite dangerous if multiple blights are cast.
* In xnh, the duration of the withering was 100-140 turns. For the big demons this might fly, but for lesser spellcasters I reduced it to 20-60 turns. In xnh I believe this could only be cast in melee range, but now it can also be cast up to 8 squares away - further increasing its deadliness.
* Being polyd into a non-living form protects against the blight spell.

### Mage Spells
#### reflection
* Ported from EvilHack
* A spell that creates a shimmering globe around the caster, granting them reflection for several turns.
* Can be dissipated with a blast of cancellation.

#### acid blast
* Ported from EvilHack
* Explodes an acid blast on its target and the surrounding squares. The damage output is dependent on the level of the monster casting it.
* The acid from this spell also has a chance of eroding any unprotected weapons or armor in open inventory.
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero up to 13 squares away.

#### ice bolt
* Ported from EvilHack
* This spell explodes a small ice storm upon its target (and surrounding squares)
* Any non-protected objects in open inventory are subject to being frozen.
* This is a low-level spell, so access to this spell is given to every monster spellcaster that has access to mage-based spells.
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero up to 13 squares away.

#### fire bolt
* Ported from EvilHack
* This spell explodes a small fireball upon its target  (and surrounding squares)
* Any flammable objects in open inventory are subject to being burned.
* This is a low-level spell, so access to this spell is given to every monster spellcaster that has access to mage-based spells.
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero up to 13 squares away.

#### destroy armor
* Altered from Vanilla NetHack, ported from EvilHack
* Having magic resistance is no longer full protection against this spell. Any piece of armor being worn can have its fixed status removed, and then can be deteriorated to the point that it's completely destroyed. Even armor that is normally erodeproof (dragonhide and dragon scales, etc) is affected. Having MR keeps the erosion level at one per cast, otherwise the erosion level is of one to three levels per cast. Blessed pieces of armor have a small chance of resisting. Armor-based quest artifacts are immune to this spell, as is crystal plate mail.

#### entomb
* Ported from xNetHack
* Used by a monster when they are low on health or fleeing. It is primarily for escape and when cast surrounds the player with boulders.
* Any mage-spellcaster can use it when desperate.
* In xnh there was also a chance to create solid walls to block the player in, this effect was removed so it only drops boulders.

#### call undead
* Ported from SLASHEM
* Call Undead can only be cast by undead and demon spellcasters
* Ranged, can be cast at the hero from up to 13 squares away.

#### evil eye
* Ported from dNetHack
* When successfully cast on the hero, this lowers your Luck by 1 point.
* Evil eye can only be cast by undead and demon spellcasters.
* Because this is implemented as a gaze attack, the player can increase their protection by being invisible or displaced. There is no maximum range to this spell.

#### cure self
* Spellcasters can use this to cure illness, blindness, withering, and rabid statuses.

## NEW ROLES

### CARTOMANCER
* The cartomancer is a unique role ported over from SpliceHack. Cartomancers are spellcasters with a focus on using cards and summoning temporary minions to do their bidding. Many parts of the role are inspired by or pay homage to various trading card games. The cartomancer has undergone some dramatic transformations from its original implementation in Splice, becoming a more focused and surprising role to play.

**Starting inventory:**
    * graphic tee
    * 40 blessed +2 razor cards
    * ~4 meat sticks
    * ~4 candy bars
    * 7 blessed summon raven cards
    * 1 random rulebook
    * 33% chance of a potion of phasing
    * sack

**Quest artifact**
The **Holographic Void Lily** is a quest artifact that functions as a chaotic credit card. When carried, it grants energy regeneration, half spell damage and reflection. Additionally, it can be invoked to provide a temporary boost in card drops, during which the Void Lily will shine brightly for 25-50 turns. This invocation effect replaces the original #invoke ability from SpliceHack, where it previously summoned a large group of random monsters.

#### Cartomancer terminology
Whilst playing as a cartomancer, much of the standard NetHack terminology is revised:

| item               | renamed as          |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| scrolls            | "cards"             |
| spellbooks         | "rulebooks"         |
| credit cards       | "banned cards"      |
| boomerangs         | "bent cards"        |
| expensive cameras  | "holographic cards" |
| hawaiian shirts    | "graphic tees"      |
| lock picks         | "worthless cards"   |
| scrolls under $100 | "common"            |
| scrolls for $100   | "uncommon"          |
| scrolls for $200   | "rare"              |
| scrolls for $300   | "legendary"         |
* Whenever you or a monster reads a scroll, they instead "play" that card.

#### Cartomancer rarity descriptions
Scrolls are also labeled according to their rarity. In the original SpliceHack implementation, this reflected the price. So a $100 card would be "uncommon", a $200 card would be rare, and so on. With the nerfing of price identification, this system has been revised so that the actual probability of cards is reflected. The following chart describes how this works.

| Card            | Rarity | Description |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| cloning         | 10     | legendary   |
| charging        | 15     | legendary   |
| genocide        | 15     | legendary   |
| knowledge       | 15     | legendary   |
| taming          | 15     | legendary   |
| punishment      | 15     | legendary   |
| stinking cloud  | 15     | legendary   |
| earth           | 18     | rare        |
| food detection  | 25     | rare        |
| fire            | 30     | rare        |
| gold detection  | 33     | rare        |
| amnesia         | 35     | rare        |
| flood           | 35     | rare        |
| scare monster   | 35     | rare        |
| magic mapping   | 45     | uncommon    |
| destroy armor   | 45     | uncommon    |
| create monster  | 45     | uncommon    |
| confuse monster | 53     | uncommon    |
| teleportation   | 55     | uncommon    |
| enchant armor   | 63     | common      |
| remove curse    | 65     | common      |
| enchant weapon  | 80     | common      |
| light           | 90     | common      |
| identify        | 180    | common      |

#### Card abuse penalties
* Cartomancers receive severe alignment penalties for forging or defacing cards.
  - writing cards: -20 alignment, -5 luck
  - cloning cards: -20 alignment, -5 luck
  - polymorphing cards: -10 alignment, -2 luck

#### Play mechanics
* Cards (scrolls) only weigh 1 for cartomancers.
* Rulebooks (spellbooks) only weigh 5 for cartomancers.
* The camera is played as a holographic card for cartomancers, doesn't break when thrown.
* When applying a deck of cards, cartomancers will always be able to use them as if they
  were blessed.
  - For playing card decks, this enables you to easily evaluate your current luck.
  - For decks of fate, you will have a bonus toward a better result.
* Cartomancers don't break illiterate conduct when playing cards.

#### No perma-pets
Cartomancers do not receive a starting pet and are unable to tame monsters in the usual way. When food is thrown at domestic animals, it only pacifies them rather than taming them. Any figurines that generate are automatically converted into summon cards, and the rulebook of create familiar also produces summon cards instead of familiars. All standard methods of creating permanent pets have been nullified for Cartomancers. On the Astral Plane, they receive an archon card in place of a guardian angel. When reading a confused scroll of cloning, they will simply receive a summon card instead of a possible tame pet.

#### Melee combat nerfs
* Cartomancers are not great melee fighters - they prefer ranged weapons or fighting behind their summoned help. They have some severe penalties for melee combat.
* There is a flat -5 to-hit penalty for all melee combat.
* If wearing armor, they receive an additional -20 to-hit penalty
* If wearing a shield, they receive an additional -10 to-hit penalty
* If attacking with a wielded weapon, they receive an additional -10 to-hit penalty.

#### Card drops
When playing as a cartomancer, there is a chance that a monster will leave a card instead of a corpse upon death. Initially, this chance is 50%, but as you level up and progress deeper into the dungeon, the chance gradually decreases. When a monster dies and is eligible for a drop, one of three outcomes can occur: a razor card (with any BUC status or enchantment) may be dropped, a zap card may appear, or a summon card might be left behind. Summon drops are the most complex, as they can vary depending on RNG. The drop could be the same card as the monster that was killed, a higher difficulty monster, a random monster, or a sphere. If the monster is low level (below 3), it often doesn't leave any card. However, nasty monsters always drop their own summon cards.

* Some monsters are restricted from dropping cards:
  * spell beings
  * revived monsters (zombies and trolls that have been killed once and come back)
  * cancelled monsters
  * phoenixes (they always leave an egg)
  * cloned monsters (gremlins, blue jellies, etc.)
  * Keystone Kops (they can be farmed)
* Cartomancers don't get card drops while polymorphed.

#### Spell beings
Spell beings originally came from SLASH'EM. Whenever the flame sphere or freeze sphere spells were cast, they would summon a temporary sphere, which counted as a spell being. These beings are tame and act like pets, but they have a limited lifespan. (In SLASH'EM, there was no lifespan unless you left them on a level, causing them to become untame.) Here, when the cartomancer plays a summon card, it will summon a spell being with a predetermined lifespan that will fight aggressively for you, ignoring any hesitation a regular pet might exhibit and never stopping to eat or hide. If you receive credit for killing a spell being, they only grant 1 XP. Spell beings never leave corpses and spawn with no inventory. Spell-beings also don't count toward vanquished or special logged monsters.

Spell beings have a "sparkling" description in farlook, so you can distinguish them from permanent monsters.

** Lifetime of spell-beings:**
| XPLev | Turns |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 19    |
| 5     | 35    |
| 10    | 55    |
| 15    | 75    |
| 20    | 95    |
| 25    | 115   |
| 30    | 135   |

#### Summon cards
For cartomancers, cards of create monster are twice as common as for other roles, and when these cards spawn, they are keyed to a specific summon monster card. Cartomancers begin the game with seven summon raven cards and have opportunities to expand their collection as they slay monsters. Whilst low-level monsters rarely drop their own summon cards, there is always a small chance that any death drop will leave a higher-level monster card. As the cartomancer's level increases, so does the strength of these rare drops.

The price of summon cards scales according to the difficulty of the monster they summon. In addition to reading summon cards, cartomancers can also throw them to activate the effect, which allows them to summon monsters at a distance, directly next to a threat.

Monsters can also read summon cards, so it’s important for cartomancers to collect them before they are used against them. Cursed summon cards will always create hostile monsters.

Activating summon cards costs 10101010101010101010 energy per card. If the cartomancer lacks enough energy, the card will have no effect and will not be consumed. Unique monsters can drop summon cards, with a few exceptions, such as the Wizard of Yendor and the Riders, due to their ability to revive. Additionally, cartomancers can receive summon cards by offering corpses. Although these cards do not count as artifact gifts they will still increase the prayer timeout.

#### Explosive summon cards
Summon "sphere" cards are special because they instantly explode when thrown at a monster. However, if cursed, they will not explode and instead summon a hostile sphere, which includes gas spores and volatile mushrooms. Exploding sphere monster cards are more likely to drop for cartomancers, providing them with useful ranged explosive options.

These monster cards are eligible for this mechanic:
* freezing spheres
* flaming spheres
* acid spheres
* shocking spheres
* stinking spheres
* volatile mushrooms
* gas spores

#### Razor cards
In **NerfHack**, razor cards have been properly implemented as their own weapon type, using the shuriken skill, unlike in **SpliceHack**, where they were simply renamed shuriken. Razor cards deal 1d6 damage to both small and large creatures, have a +2 to-hit bonus, and weigh 1. Cartomancers can multishot with shuriken-skill projectiles, such as shuriken and razor cards, and they gain multishot bonuses up to expert skill. However, they do not receive additional multishot bonuses at master skill level, though they still benefit from increased damage and to-hit bonuses.

Razor cards will occasionally appear as part of a cartomancer’s regular death drops, sometimes replacing summon or zap cards. These follow the same rules as stacked weapons, so they may appear in stacks of 6-11 and could be blessed, cursed, unblessed, or possibly even poisoned. The strength damage bonus applies exclusively to thrown razor cards, and no other projectile qualifies for this bonus.

If a player comes across a deck of cards that they have no use for, they can #tip the deck to empty it, yielding a potentially large stack of razor cards.

#### Zappable cards
Zap cards, which function as one-use wands, can drop when cartomancers kill monsters. These cards have a 0% generation chance for other roles, meaning only cartomancers will encounter them. Cursed zap cards have a chance to backfire like wands, but they cannot explode. Playing zap cards requires 10 energy per card.

Cartomancers will never see wands generate. Anytime a wand would spawn it is instead replaced with its equivalent zap card. It's important to note that monsters can and will use both zap and summon cards against the player, so it's crucial to collect them as soon as they drop.

#### Spellcasting overhaul
Cartomancers do not learn spells in the traditional way, meaning they cannot acquire spells from starting books, reading spellbooks, or receiving gifts from gods. Instead, they cast spells instantaneously by reading rulebooks. These rulebooks generate with 4-5 charges, and each reading consumes one charge. Once all charges are used, the rulebook is consumed and disappears.

Cartomancers begin the game knowing the identities of all rulebooks, as the title and purpose of a rulebook are typically clear from the cover. They always cast spells at expert level, ensuring high proficiency. Whilst rulebooks can still be written using magic markers without penalties (unlike when forging cards), they cannot be recharged with scrolls of charging. Additionally, cartomancers are able to read rulebooks even when blind.

**Card combos:**
* The 'Z' spellcasting command is instead is used for card combos that the cartomancer gets access to as they level up.
* Card combos do not become available until level 5. You gain the ability to cast more cards as you level up:
  * level 5: 3 cards
  * level 10: 4 cards
  * level 15+: 5 cards
* Starting the combo costs 5 energy. Further cards cost 10 energy per card to play as normal.

**Cartomancers get special bonuses for wielding crystal balls:**
Whilst wielding a crystal ball, a cartomancer will enjoy:
    * max charisma
    * telepathy
    * see invisible
    * astral vision

**Changes to the cartomancer quest:**
* Created a unique duelist monster to take the place of students in the cartomancer quest.
* The cartomancer quest levels have received some updates and detailing.
* Buffed the King of Games and Dal Zethire.

Cartomancer gets adjusted different item generation odds.
    To make up for less corpse drops, they get more food.
    They also get much fewer wands because they get zap cards.

### New race/role combos.

* Elven archeologist
* Orcish archeologist
* Elvish healer
* Dwarven knight
* Dwarven priest
* Orcish priest
* Elvish rogue
* Gnomish rogue
* Elvish tourist
* Gnomish tourist
* Dwarven barbarian

### Racial item preferences

* Monsters of certain races will usually prefer their own equipment and find other racial equipment awkward or uncomfortable to use.
  * Elves hate dwarvish, gnomish, and orcish objects
  * Orcs hate dwarvish, gnomish, and elven objects
  * Dwarves hate orcish, gnomish, and elven objects
  * Gnomes hate dwarvish, orcish, and elven objects
  * Humans/vampires hate gnomish objects (too small) - but otherwise they can use all other racial equipment

The effects of wearing armor or wielding weapons you hate:
* +5AC penalty for each piece
* -5 to-hit penalty for each piece
* To make the mechanic obvious, you receive an explicit message when wearing or wielding any hated object.
* You'll also receive periodic messages when fighting to remind you your to-hit is suffering.
* When throwing items your race dislikes, they have a 1 in 7 chance of slipping - same as a cursed or greased projectile.

This mechanic also applies to monsters, but they will also simply avoid using items they don't like.


## New races


### Vampires
Vampires have a rich history in NetHack, first appearing in SLASH'EM and later in UnNetHack, dNetHack, SpliceHack, and Hack'EM, with each implementation being slightly different. In this version, the aim was to combine the best aspects of each to create a fun yet balanced vampire race. Vampires start strong, avoiding issues like poison or GWAWOD deaths, and they can fly over many floor traps, such as sleeping gas. What you *will* have to worry about is your new worst enemies: silver and hunger:

You'll also have to move quickly and attack aggressively to keep draining blood for nutrition. The corpse draining mechanic from SLASH'EM has been removed. It created quite a few bugs in the nutrition code, it resulted in tedious draining of corpses (which often are wasted anyway), and a better alternative was found in SpliceHack, which was simply doubling the nutrition from feeding on life blood during combat. The main drawback to this approach is that now vampirics cannot gain intrinsics or benefits from eating corpses. To compensate, you start off with the many intrinsics a regular vampire enjoys.

Instead of the usual starting pet, vampires begin with a tame and loyal familiar. This is a humanoid (@) capable of wearing armor and wielding weapons. Vampires are now restricted from taming or pacifying any monsters except for familiars which they can tame via #chat.

#### Vampires resistances and abilities
| XL  | Intrinsic             |
| --- | --------------------- |
| 1   | Regeneration          |
| 1   | Breathless            |
| 1   | Flying                |
| 1   | Poison resistance     |
| 1   | Drain resistance      |
| 1   | Immune to death magic |
| 9   | Sleep resistance      |

(Vampires are also immune to lycanthropy, withering, and rabid statuses.)

To avoid "stupid deaths," bite attacks are prevented when fighting monsters like cockatrices, Medusa, or green slimes. Although vampires have drain level resistance, they remain vulnerable to life-draining bite attacks from other vampires. Intrinsic drain resistance does not protect against these attacks, but an extrinsic source, such as the Stormbringer, will. Vampires also feed more efficiently when their victims are confused, incapacitated, or trapped, a feature adapted from Hack'EM.

In terms of food, most rations and fruit juice potions are replaced with blood potions when playing as a vampire. This avoids creating junk items and helps the player survive longer. Interestingly, vampires prefer cursed blood, as it provides more nutrition, whilst cursed vampire blood increases their maximum hit points. In contrast, blessed blood is treated as congealed and unusable. This behavior is the opposite of SLASH'EM. Some vampires receive an opera cloak, though it is rarer than in SLASH'EM, and wearing an opera cloak grants a charisma bonus, as in UnNetHack. Potions of blood and vampire blood offer vampires a drinkable food source, but shopkeepers charge more for blood when vampires are hungry.

Like the other vampires players will encounter in the dungeon, player vampires can no longer shapeshift using the #monster command. However, they now start the game with infravision and stand alone as the sole beneficary of that intrinsic in NerfHack.

Vampires can use any racial items, except for gnomish items, which are too small for them. Additionally, they can use tinning kits to bottle blood from corpses, similar to the mechanic in SlashTHEM, but these tins provide only generic blood and do not grant any intrinsics. Vampires are inherently evil, a trait borrowed from EvilHack, and they face minimal alignment penalties for acts of cruelty, such as attacking peaceful monsters. On the Astral Plane, vampires "desire conflict," even without the conflict ability, and standing on Elbereth incurs a -5 alignment penalty.

Silver weapons also generate more frequently when playing as a vampire. After difficulty level 8 kicks in, 10% of all eligible weapons will be converted to silver. Vampires can handle silver items, but if they come into direct contact (ie: wielding a silver saber without gloves), they will take some damage and be unable to regenerate further HP. Vampires also cannot use the #turn undead command.

## SPELLCASTING CHANGES


Most of these changes are to strengthen natural spellcasters abilities and to dull roles
that don't specialize (like fighters). Non-specialists can still attempt to utilize spells
but they will have to work harder to maintain their spells. Cavemen will have a very
difficult time with spellcasting.

* The base memory retention ("KEEN") for spells is now 10000 turns, reduced from 20000 (SLASH'EM). Roles still start with 20000 turns of memory.
* When reading or re-reading a spellbook, you will bring the retention back up to 10000
* Primary spellcasters (healers, priests, monks, wizards, archeologists) get a memory boost of 500 turns when they cast spells (SLASH'EM)
* Casting your **special spell** also grants a retention bonus of 500 turns no matter what role you are
* Wielding a quarterstaff provides a small bonus to spellcasting (about a 1/3rd of the bonus a robe confers) (Fourk)
* Hungerless casting ignores too hungry to cast penalty (xnh)
* Spellbooks' weight is directly related to their level (xnh)
* When casting a SKILLED attack spell, you can choose to cast basic fireball or cone of cold (xnh/dnh)
* You get a 100 turn reminder for spells that are close to fading away
* Spellcasting no longer exercises wisdom (FIQ)
* Total hungerless casting is not possible anymore and the intelligence requirements have been increased. (FIQ)
* Healing spell effectiveness is determined by skill (Evil)
* Spellbook of identify was raised to level 5 (SLASHEM)
* Cure sickness is now directional (Evil).
* Only primary spellcasters can receive divine spellbook gifts.
* You cannot learn spells that you are restricted in.
* Spellbooks can generate pre-read.
* Casting the spell of clairvoyance at skilled lets it persist for a while.
* Display a single accurate spellcasting retention percentage in the spellbook list.

### Spellbook of charm monster
* This spell is now a directional level 3 spell and only works on the first monster hit.
* At unskilled and basic, the spell can only pacify monsters.
* You need to have skilled or expert skill in enchantment spells to tame monsters.

### Spellbook of light
Spell of light effects scale with spellcasting ability.
- At unskilled, the diameter of light is 2
- At basic, it's 4
- At skilled, it's 6, and at expert, it caps out at 7.

For reference, the uncursed scroll of light always illuminates a radius of 11.

### Spellbook of dig
* Lowered from a level 5 spell to level 3
* The range of the digging beam has been roughly halved.

### Spellbook of magic mapping
* The effectiveness of magic mapping depends on your spellcasting ability. The spell will never fully map a level, only the scroll can be depended upon for that.
* Lowered from a level 5 spell to level 4
* Unskilled acts like a confused magic mapping (1 in 7 squares successfully mapped)
* Basic maps 1 in 5 squares
* Skilled maps 1 in 3 squares
* Expert maps 1

### Spellbook of knock
* The spell of knock cannot be used to escape from an engulfer (this ability is retained for the wand of opening)
* Range is reduced to 1

### Spellbook of wizard-lock
* Range is reduced to 1

### Spellbook of drain life
* Now ray-based to match the wand of draining.


## DUNGEON CHANGES


* Extended the main dungeon to accomodate the new Lethe branch
* Removed the **mysterious force** from the game (xnh)
* **Branchport** always brings you to the entry level of a branch
* Reverted the majority of **level flips** from 3.7. Flipped levels only appear in Sokoban and the big room special level.
* The Rogue level has been disabled (many variants)
* Chickatrices and cockatrice eggs will now appear in cockatrice nests (xnh)
* Shops cannot have themed rooms with unusual floor textures (xnh)
* Random croll shops cannot be big rooms
* No special **themed rooms** generate until level 3
* Random rivers were added to many of the quest filler levels
* Trees can generate in dungeon rooms (xnh)
* Trees can be destroyed by fire, cold, and disintegration rays
* If a tree is destroyed by fire or cold, it has a 1 in 3 chance of exploding - possbily creating a chain reaction
* Random secret doors are secret less of the time (xnh)
* Random secret corridors have been removed (xnh)
* Removed the "temple of the gods" theme room. This room contains 3 altars, one of each alignment. It was removed to make the finite altars mechanic more relevant.
* There is a guaranteed thing from below guarding Rodney and chance of a vampire mage as well.
* Thrones can grant knowledge of magical items.
* Throne #sits can summon much larger audiences.
* Guaranteed pit trap just outside of wizard's zoo.
* Courtrooms generated after level 20 can be filled with vampires (dNetHack).
* Gnomish mines fill levels sometimes have varied lighting; rarely they get ice patches.
* Fake "Closed for inventory" shop engravings can appear in random places.

### SHOP CHANGES
**Lighting shops:**
* Magic lamps are one notch rarer - down to 11.3% per game now overall (Spork)

#### New shop: Junk Shop
* Ported from SpliceHack
* This counts as a general store that is usually pre-populated with a bunch of junky items.

#### New shop: Collectible Card Game Company
* Brand new debuting in NerfHack!
* This shop only spawns for cartomancers and features a large variety of summon cards, with the occasional deck box or backpack.
* This will take the place of most food and weapon shops to give the cartomancer more ammo to work with.

### Castle changes

* The castle level is now marked as a graveyard
* Castle barracks may open into courtyard instead of throne room, letting soldiers flood the courtyard more quickly (xnh)
* Added iron bars to the castle perimeter
* Iron bars have been added to the castle towers (Spork)
* The location of the chest containing the wand of wishing has been obfuscated. You will find matching chests and scrolls in each of the towers if you use object detection. The other chests have wands of nothing inside (Spork)
* The drawbridge passtune range has been expanded by one square (xnh)
* The drawbridge also does not always close with the passtune, one out of five times it will malfunction when trying to close it (xnh)
* Castle courtyards are unlit
* The castle gets a guaranteed forge.

### Valley of the Dead

* Players can't regenerate hit points whilst in the Valley of the Dead (Evil)
* Instead of dart traps, the player will encounter magic traps (Evil)
* Less ghosts are guaranteed in the valley

### The Lethe Branch

* The Lethe Patch is a classic set of levels and changes; it has been converted from 3.4.3 DES format to 3.7.0 LUA and adapted for NerfHack.
* Technicially, it doesn't count as a real "branch" in nethack terms. The levels are simply sequenced after Medusa's level. This is different from the implementation in the SLethe patch, but was programmed this way so that most of the other dungeon teleportation and travel mechanics would still function as normal.
* Cerberus now guards the entrace to the Valley.
* One major change from the original Lethe patch is that the Castle level now appears as the precursor to the lethe branch shortly after Medusa's Island (it does not count as a lethe level). This is to give the player access to the valuable loot in the castle before taking on the challenges of the Lethe, it also is less disruptive to the layout.
* The lethe water mechanic was not imported. In its place, many oppressive mechanics take effect
* All lethe levels are undiggable, hardfloor, and no teleport.
* More traps were added to these levels, especially anti-magic fields
* Many items that were guaranteed in the original lethe patch (or dnh) were minimized or eliminated.
* There are up to four potential altars available in the Lethe branch. Each altar has a 50% chance of appearing. If it does appear, there is a further 50% chance it's pre-cracked.
Lethe effects:
  * You cannot gain experience.
  * You don't gain skill points for using skills
  * Spellcasters don't get a memory boost for casting spells on lethe levels.
  * There are no extra death drops from monsters.
  * Cartomancers don't get card drops in Lethe levels.
  * You cannot read spellbooks to learn spells, you become disoriented during attempts.
  * You cannot engrave Elbereth, you instead forget how and become confused.
  * One cannot write spellbooks or scrolls effectively in the lethe levels.
  * Lethe levels make spellcasting a little more difficult.
  * Energy regeneration is slower on Lethe levels.
  * Lethe levels make you burn more nutrition than normal.
  * Monsters don't generate peaceful in the Lethe branch.

### Enhanced Gehennom

* The fake wizard levels have been removed.
* The wizard's tower levels have been moved out of Gehennom and extracted to their own branch (xNetHack/EvilHack)
* The portal to the wizard's tower has been moved to a random castle tower and changed to a stair up.

* Most demon lairs are now phaseproof
* Marked the Asmodeus levels as cold and added cold traps
* Juiblex gets some puddles and a shoggoth

### Gulf of N'kai
* The last four levels of Gehennom have been replaced with the maps.
* Lava replaces the lethe water flowing through the levels.
* These levels are NOT flagged with the "lethe" flag.
* The final N'kai level takes the place of the standard vibrating square level.

### Sokoban

* Sokoban levels are cold and icy - legend has it a white dragon named Wintercloak took the tower over, leaving a trail of frost in its wake. In addition to the level being colored blue with splashes of icey cyan, you will see random patches of ice form in the level. Because they are cold, if potions land on the floor, they have a chance of freezing and shattering.
* Note: A recent change from NetHack 3.7 also makes ice occasionally slide the player in a random direction.
* Sokoban now has two additional levels - an entry level with river obstacles (adapted from the town filler level from UnNetHack) and another puzzle level to solve.
* Monsters are never generated peaceful in Sokoban (FIQ)
* Zombies don't revive in Sokoban and they won't dig out of the ground.
* Monsters won't break boulders in Sokobon.
* All the vanilla sokoban levels have been replaced with the SLASH'EM puzzles.
* The Dragon of Bactria level was added from NetHack Fourk; the green dragon was replaced with a white dragon
* All Soko zoos have the white dragon guarding the treasure.
* The zoos in Soko have been expanded slightly.
* Flavored most Sokoban levels with more iron bars.
* Decorated the levels with white dragon statues in honor of the new steward.
* In addition to the amulet and bag, the Sokoban prize can also be a cloak of magic resistance or a magic marker.
* Sokoban prizes are always erodeproofed.
* Stop Sokoban guilt after acquiring the prize.
* The iron bars in some of the Soko levels can be phased through, but it now incurs a Luck penalty.
* You will now receive a message when incurring a Sokobon Luck penalty.
* Sokoban maps above puzzle #2 get 2 mimics.

### Fort Ludios
* Ported two Fort Ludios variants (Evil/Un)
* Some mermaids were added to patrol the moats.

### Minetown/Mines End
* Ported zoo town and lavender town (Splice)
* Ported Creek Town and Mini-Castle town (THEM)
* Imported the Gnomish Sewer (xnh)
* Imported 3 mines end variants (THEM)

### Oracle
* The Oracle level now appears from levels 8-11.
* Ported Oracle variations 2 and 3 (Splice)
* Allow dungeon features to generate in the Oracle level.

### Temple to Moloch level
* Ported from SLASH'EM
* Gargoyles replace the statue gargoyles in the original map.
* Winged gargoyles replace 4 of the original gargoyles.
* 2 ghoul mages were added.

### Lost Tomb level
* Ported from SLASH'EM

### Big Room
* Ported bigroom variants from UnNetHack and SpliceHack.
* Imported two bigroom variants from xnh.
* An additional big room was added to the latter half of the main dungeon (Splice)

### Grass
* Ported using code from xNetHack, SpliceHack, and HackEM.
* Monsters can hide under grass (from xNetHack).
* You cannot dust engrave on grassy tiles.
* Burned engravings also burn up grass.
* Added grass to big rooms.

### Puddles
* Ported from EvilHack and SlashTHEM.
* Puddles act as a nerf for early water sources by limiting a useful resource for diluting and blanking items.
* Many pools are replaced with puddles instead.
* Fountains gush out puddles instead of pools
* Disarming a rust trap results in a puddle instead of a fountain
* Scrolls of flood mostly create puddles instead of pools (unless cursed)
* Whetstones can be used in puddles and can dry up puddles.
* Tiny monsters can drown in puddles (relevant if polymorphed into one)

### Forges
* Forges were ported in from EvilHack
* Forges let the player repair metallic armor, bless items, dispose of zombies or organic items, dispose of the iron ball and chain, and summon lava demons and fire elementals.
* Forging recipes are available in the object lookup
* Weapons can be forged by applying a hammer whilst standing on a forge.
* Items can pass over forges.
* New forging feature: There is a one-time 1 in 30 chance of erodeproofing an item when dipping in a forge. After this occurs, the forge will instead emit a puff of steam.
* Forges always light up the square they occupy.
* Cold rays have a chance cool forges.
* Forges burn the grease and poison off dipped items.

#### FORGING & FORGING RECIPES
* Ported from EvilHack with modifications.
* No artifact forging
* No armor recipes are available if you aren't a dwarf or orc.
* Much narrower list of forgeable weapons, mostly bladed and blunt weapons.
* Only samurai can forge katanas, tsurugi, and shuriken.
* Only dwarves can forge dwarvish items
* Only orcs can forge orcish items
* Forging recipes are displayed in the object lookup.

Aside from the recipe changes - the biggest change is that we no longer have a #forge or #craft command. Simply get a hammer and (a)pply it when standing over the forge.

### Toilets
Toilets have received many enhancements after adapting them from SLASHEM. Notably, toilets can now appear on their own, separate from sinks, whereas in SLASH'EM, they only came in pairs with sinks. Overall, their frequency has been dialed way back so they are quite rare.

* Toilet prayer can now stop the vomiting process
* Praying at toilets can cure sickness.
* Sitting on toilets can alleviate satiated status.
* If giants sit on toilets, they break.
* Sitting on toilets fully heals your HP.
* Toilets can sometimes break when sat on.

#### Toilet kicking:
* Like sinks, toilets now have a couple different effects from kicking them, including a few YAFM.
* Kicking now only breaks the toilet 1/7 chance (was 1/4 in SLASH'EM)
* Kicking can generate giant cockroaches and pools from kicking (1 in 17 chance)
* Kicking can generate brown puddings (only once per toilet)
* Kicking can generate a random tool. Normally this tool will weigh under 15aum, but sometimes you'll get a large tool that bonks against the piping. If a large tool bonks 3x - you'll get that tool no matter now big it is and the toilet is destroyed in the process.

Dipping an edged weapon into a toilet can poison it, but also probably rust any metallic items.

### Bloody tiles
* Ported from SpliceHack
* When a monster is killed, it can spray blood around the surrounding tiles depending on it's size.
* The blood is mostly cosmetic, however, players cannot engrave in the dust whilst blood covers that tile.
* Blood can be wiped off with a towel, or will wear off after enough activity.
* Fire and acid rays also burn off blood from tiles.
* Bloody doors are more difficult to open and close.

### Traps
* Polytraps disappear with 1 in 7 chance when a monster steps on one.
* Invisibility from magic traps lasts a long time (2500-5000 turns), instead of permanently.
* Disabled paranoid confirm for walking into vapor/clouds.
* Anti-magic fields block spellcasting for the player and monsters
* Anti-magic fields also block wand zapping
* Arrow traps and dart traps cannot be avoided by flight.

* **Partially reverted commit 5c7c9d10a from 3.7.0** - Rejigger anti-magic traps. I thought the severity of the
  original change was actually fine, anti-magic traps were historically a joke in NetHack
  3.4.3 so this makes them somewhat threatening.

#### Falling rock traps
* At higher levels, boulders can drop from falling rock traps.
* Falling rock traps can result in stunning with sufficient damage (at least 6)
* Falling rock traps can drop multiple rocks (or boulders).
* You cannot fly over falling rock traps.
* You can now #untrap falling rock traps, obtaining rocks (from nhfourk).

#### Spear traps
* A new floor trap ported from EvilHack
* Spear traps only start appearing after level 5
* Spear traps can be untrapped, potentially yielding a random spear type in the process.
* Flying and levitation usually protect from being harmed by spear traps, however, there is still a 25% chance of being hit (by a abnormally long spear)
* If you or a monster hit by the trap is thick skinned, the spear just breaks and the trap is deleted.
* The trap also doesn't affect unsolid monsters.
* When hit, it deals 7-14 damage and wounds your legs for 10-19 turns.
* Spear traps sometimes have poisoned spears.
* Spear traps abuse strength and constitution.

#### Magic beam traps
* A new trap ported from EvilHack
* Magic beam traps only start appearing after level 14
* When you (or a monster) steps on this trap, it shoots a random ray type from a pre-set location that crosses through the beam trap. The beam type is set for each trap, so once you notice it shoots fire rays, it will always shoot fire rays.
* Magic beam traps can very rarely shoot disintegration rays.

#### Grease traps
* A new creation debuting in NerfHack
* Grease traps function similarly to rust traps, but they spray a blast of grease at the player or monster that stepped on it.
* When you step on a grease trap, you either slip in a puddle of grease or get sprayed by a grease hose.
* When stepped on, the trap disarms with a random 1 in 15 chance.
* You can also #untrap grease traps, if successful you may yield a rubber hose or a can of grease.

**Puddle of grease:**
  * If you don't have levitation or flying, you gain fumbling ("You step in a puddle of grease.")
  * Slipping in grease traps can cause you or monsters to become paralyzed for a few turns and inflicts a small amount of damage.
  * Mud boots and water walking boots protect from slipping on grease traps.

**Grease hose:**
  * If the grease hits your head, you are blinded unless you are wearing a visored helmet. Your blindfold/lenses/etc may also become greased and fall off.
  * If the grease hits your arm, your weapon(s) or shield can become greased and fall off. You also gain the Glib condition for 10 to 15 turns.
  * If the grease hits your feet, your boots can become greased and fall off.
  * Otherwise, the grease hits your torso and your outermost armor becomes greased. Random items you are carrying can also become greased and fall from your possession. If you are carrying a towel, there is a 50% chance it becomes greased as well. If you are riding a steed the saddle will get hit with grease, making you fall off.
* When a monster gets hit with grease, it will randomly grease an item in their inventory.

#### Door traps
* Door traps actually explode in a ball of flame (Evil)
* These traps will start appearing at level 8.

#### Booby-trapped tins
* From xNetHack
* Randomly generated tins have a 1 in 30 chance of exploding in a blast of fire when opened.
* Tins that you create from tinning kits will always be safe.


## Special Rooms


### Art rooms
* Ported from SpliceHack
* These rooms have a one-time event that occurs upon entering a room
* Most of the time it's a fun piece of art depicting something with the denizens of the dungeon. But sometimes it's a special effect.
  * You might see an image of your god, invoking enlightenment
  * You might find a partial map of the level
  * You might encounter a scary image, stunning you for a few turns
  * You might discover a new item
* Art rooms help exercise INT and WIS, depending on the room
* To get any effects, you must not be blind when you enter the room

### Room colors patch
* Most special rooms get a distinctive color or combination of colors.

### New room: dragon lair (from SLASH'EM).
* Dragon scales can sometimes appear in dragon lairs.
* Dragon lairs now produce special sounds when they appear on levels.

### New room: giant courtroom (from SLASH'EM).
* Giant courts sometimes have tinning kits.
* Monsters in giant courts are always hostile.

### New room: Real zoo (from SLASH'EM).
* Monsters in real zoos are always hostile.

### New room: Fungus farm (from SLASH'EM).
* Features a collection of slimy and oozy monsters.

### New room: Migo hive (from SLASH'EM).
* Only appears in the Lethe branch


## Altars, Prayer, and Priests


* When donating to priests - the gold vanishes upon receipt
* Protection that can be bought from priests or granted by your god only ever grants 1AC per granting; the more protection the player has, the less likely it is to be granted (K-Mod)
* Greater chance of hostile minions appearing when converting an altar. Especially if the altar is in an occupied temple (Evil)
* Converting altars has higher chance of summoning minions (SLASH'EM)
* Intrinsics speed, stealth, and telepathy are no longer granted by the gods when #offering.
* Getting troubles fixed by prayer abuses constitution.
* Permanent alignment conversion prevents more divine protection from being granted

### Altar cracking
**Once the player has received two gifts or has been crowned, altars have a 50% chance to crack with each subsequent gift.**

* There are two stages to the cracking. In the first stage the altar becomes partially cracked, which is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the altar's functionality. This cracked status can be seen on an altar by farlooking. However, receiving another gift from a cracked altar will certainly destroy it, losing it forever.
* Being crowned also counts as a gift. If you are crowned on a cracked altar, it will also almost always destroy it in the process (however - there is a 1 in 13 chance that the altar will survive the process).
* Altars on the Astral Plane will never be destroyed. Note that they can still become cracked but are safe from destruction.
* Altars also sometimes generate cracked. 1 in 4 altars will generate pre-cracked
* Many of the guaranteed altars in quests now have a good chance to already be cracked. This is especially true if they are unattended or unaligned, implying there was recent conflict and the altar was damaged.
* Altars only generate in the main dungeon starting at level 6 
* Altars are always cracked after level 15.
* If more than one altar generates on a standard dungeon level, additional altars are always cracked.
* Converting an altar will also frequently crack it. This occurs 1 in 13 times the altar is converted or 1/3rd of the time hostile minions are summoned.
* Non-chaotic same-race sacrifice always cracks altar, as does throwing vampire blood onto an altar to convert it.

The original altar nerf came from SpliceHack, where altars had a 50% chance of being destroyed after two artifact gifts had been bestowed.

A new conduct was added to the #conduct menu so that players can track how many altars have been destroyed in their current game. Altar cracking is livelogged on game servers for the entertainment value.

### #offer GIFT ODDS
**Altar gift frequency is tempered by your experience level (EvilHack).**

As your level increases, the probability of receiving an artifact increases. Under level 4 is not possible:
* level  4: 20% chance
* level  6: 30% chance
* level  8: 40% chance
* level 11: 50% chance
* level 13: 60% chance
* level 15: 70% chance
* level 17: 80% chance
* level 18: 90% chance
* level 20 or greater: 100% chance

This rewards leveling up and slows down the power grab that some characters might go for with a guaranteed sacrifice gift (ie: Barbarians). It also slows down the rate at which altars are cracking and getting destroyed, giving more time to utilize them for other things like building Luck or getting crowned.

* The raw odds of receiving an artifact have been adjusted in favor of the player, especially after 2 gifts have been granted.

| Gifts Granted | Old odds | New odds |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0             | 10.00%   | 12.50%   |
| 1             | 8.33%    | 10.00%   |
| 2             | 5.56%    | 8.33%    |
| 3             | 3.57%    | 7.14%    |
| 4             | 2.38%    | 6.25%    |
| 5             | 1.67%    | 5.56%    |
| 6             | 1.22%    | 5.00%    |
| 7             | 0.93%    | 4.55%    |
| 8             | 0.72%    | 4.17%    |
| 9             | 0.58%    | 3.85%    |
| 10            | 0.48%    | 3.57%    |

* The number of artiwishes is not factored in when determining the chance of a gift. The revised gift probabilities still apply, just filtered through the level check.

### CROWNING
* Crowning requires 13 Luck (from dnh).
* Crowning only grants *up to* 3 intrinsics. In Vanilla, crowning would grant fire, cold, poison, sleep, and shock resistance, as well as see invisible.
* Intrinsic see invisible is no longer granted via crowning
* Intrinsic telepathy is no longer granted via crowning
* In NerfHack, the game will roll 3 times to pick random intrinsics. On each roll, if the player already possesses that intrinsic, the roll is lost - otherwise the player gains it permanently.
* Crowning gifts are only granted when crowned, never for #offer.
* Your god will not crown you until you have completed the quest.
* Crowning makes it impossible to change alignment ever again.


## THE QUEST

* Removed the quest turn limit (Un)
* Players can enter the quest as soon as they reach level XL 10 (Un)
* Prevent the player from skipping most of the quest (from xNetHack).
  * Mark all quest levels as hardfloor.
  * Players cannot do horizontal or downward teleporting while the quest nemesis is alive.


## INTRINSICS AND EXTRINSICS


* The new Saving Grace feature introduced in 3.7.0 has been disabled.
* The beginner flag is only set true for tourists. This means that you will usually be able to use-test items more effectively in the very early game.
* Invisibility and see invisible cannot be permanently gained intrinsically (xnh)
* Telepathy cannot be permanently gained intrinsically
* Teleportitis cannot be permanently gained intrinsically.
* Teleport control cannot be permanently gained intrinsically.
* Amnesia can make you forget intrinsic telepathy.
* Intrinsic disintegration resistance doesn't protect items from disintegration.
* Strength doesn't affect to-hit calculations.
* Regeneration only causes additional hunger when it's actually healing your HP.
* Free action protects from stoning paralysis.
* Magic resistance and spell damage reduction only halve magic missile damage instead of preventing it (Evil)
* The chance of gaining levels from wraiths has been reduced using the SLASH'EM version of edible wraith corpses.
* Strength gain nerfs: giant corpses have less of a chance of conferring strength gain (from 50% to 25%) (SLASHEM)
* Lessen confusing messages for confuse monster effects wearing off.
* Passive fire damage burns away slime.
* Phasing allows escape from being engulfed (Evil)
* Max carry capacity has been raised to 1250, with strength playing a larger factor in its calculation.

### PARTIAL INTRINSICS
* Ported from EvilHack
* Instead of binary resistances where the player either has it or doesn't, the player gradually builds up their resistance from 0% to 100%.
* When eating a corpse, player gains a percentage of certain intrinsics.
* Percentage gained is based on the weight of the corpse; minimum being 2% and maximum at 25% (capped at 100%).
* Tins convey the same percentage from whatever they are made from.
* You will always get a percentage intrinsic from each corpse eaten.
* You receive all intrinsics that the corpse can convey if there are multiple intrinsics it can give (ie: eating a black pudding corpse grants a small percentage each of poison, cold, and shock resistance.)
* Damage/effects dealt felt are adjusted based on the percentage intrinsic currently possessed. Damage reduction is rounded down, requiring slightly more resistance to be effective.
* Gremlins steal (25 + d25)% of your intrinsics
* Cold traps and ice demons also steal (25 + d25)% of your cold resistance.
* Enlightenment always shows the partial percentage acquired for intrinsics. If you have an extrinsic source that will be displayed separately.

### PARTIAL REFLECTION
* Ported from EvilHack
* Reflection will deflect most, but not all, of the effects of ray attacks.
  * Example: You are hit by a cold ray, it reflects off your amulet of reflection, but you don't yet possess cold resistance.
* If you don't have sleep resistance, but you reflect a sleep ray, you will fall asleep for 1d6 turns (which could be lessened by your current level of sleep resistance).
* If you reflect disintegration ray, you still take 12d6 damage (subject to your current level of disintegration resistance).
* If you reflect a death ray, you still take damage and lose max HP. This can be mitigated by magic resistance and half-spell damage, but is impossible to fully prevent.
* Item destruction from elemental effects (like fire or cold) is prevented when rays are reflected.
* Reflection only provides partial protection from **floating eye gazes** - the player will still be subject to d2 turns of paralysis without free action. This is weighted on Luck, so the higher your Luck the better the chance to avoid the gaze.
* **Medusa's gaze** cannot be reflected back from more than 3 squares away.
* If reflected, Medusa will protect herself from her own gaze 98% of the time.

### Gaze attack protection
* Displacement protects from gaze attacks, only letting 1 in 11 gaze attacks find the player
* Invisibility protects from gaze attacks, only letting 1 in 11 gaze attacks find the player
* Darkness offers protection from gaze attacks (as long as the player is on a dark square and the gazer doesn't have infravision and the player is infravisible).
* If a gazer is in melee range, it will bypass invisibility and darkness protection.
* Hallucination always protects against floating eye gaze.
* Hallucination negates all incoming gaze attacks, except Medusa's glare (from xNetHack).

### Slow digestion nerf
* Slow digestion now functions in a fashion opposite of the ring of hunger.
* Slow digestion only prevents hunger for 1 in every 2 turns
* The previous Vanilla behavior slowed hunger to only occur 1 in 20 turns

### Stealth changes
* To bring back the feeling of the 3.4.3 **stealth** mechanic, the chance of sleeping monsters waking up and growling has been lowered dramatically and is based on luck.
  * 0 Luck: 12.5% chance of a monster screaming when roused.
  * 2+ Luck: 0.3% chance
  * Negative luck has at least a 30% chance of rousing monsters.

### Aggravate Monster changes
* Cannibalism causes aggravation for 10-15k turns instead of permanently.
* Eating domestic animals causes aggravation for 5000-7500 turns instead of permanently.
* Intrinsic aggravate monster increases monster difficulty by 5 (stacks with extrinsic).
* Aggravate monster spell cast at hero causes intrinsic aggravation for 50-300 turns.
* Aggravate monster causes monsters not to be scared of musical instruments.
* Ring of aggravate monster causes pets to attack anything without fear.
* Note: The ring of aggravate monster increases the monster generation difficulty by 15 (this was already implemented in NetHack 3.7, but it's worth including here as a recent change)

### Impaired Actions
* Allow #terrain whilst impaired (xnh)
* Falling downstairs does more damage - 2d3 instead of 1d3. (K-Mod)
* Falling down a hole or pit whilst fumbling (or very low dex) can make you fall on a wielded weapon.
* Going downstairs whilst stunned always results in falling, confusion sometimes does.
* Don't allow stunned jumping. Confused jumping has a 20% chance to fail (Evil)
* Many item actions are now forbidden if you have both hands welded.
* If you (or a monster) are stuck in a pit, the range of wand zaps and thrown items is limited to the  squares adjacent to the pit.
* Hallucination affects all item descriptions and appearances in and outside of your inventory (SLASHEM)
* Auto-pickup is automatically disabled whilst hallucinating.


## MECHANICS CHANGES


### WISHING
* Quest artifacts cannot be wished for (dnh)
* Attempting to wish for quest artifacts doesn't use up a wish
* Wishes no longer increase prayer timeout (Dyna)
* Wishes from thrones are much more rare. The chance of getting a wish from sitting on a throne is now about 1.5%. If the player doesn't get a wish, they lose 1 point of Luck. Once the player is granted a wish from a throne, the throne is guaranteed to disappear. (Evil with adjustments)
* The chance of getting a djinn from a smoky potion has been halved. The actual chances of getting a wish from the djinn have not been changed.
* Players have a chance of getting a wish from crowning now (if no intrinsics were granted).
* Artiwishes only care about previous **successful** artiwishes.
* Wishing with bad luck causes amnesia.

There are a few new sources of wishes:
* Using the Deck of Fate can result in a wish if you draw The World card. The deck is then used up.
* If you get crowned and you have all the resistances that are offered, you can get a wish.
* If you zap a wand of wonder and get the wand of wishing effect (and pass a 1 in 100 roll), you can get a wish. The odds of getting a wish on any given zap are (1/28) * (1/100) for 1 in 2800 per zap.

**The chance of receiving the artifact from a wish is:**

    1 in [number of previous artifact wishes + 1].

  * Artifact wish #1: 1 in 1 chance of success (100%)
  * Artifact wish #2: 1 in 2 chance of success (50%)
  * Artifact wish #3: 1 in 3 chance of success (33%)
  * And so on.

### Slow Luck timeouts (modified)
In NerfHack, Luck items greatly slow down Luck timeout rather than stopping it completely - this is similar to how it works in UnNetHack. However, the timeouts have been modified and extended to cover negative base luck situations. The timeouts have also been reduced heavily from the UnNetHack calculations.

The modified Luck timeout depends on how far your Luck is from your base Luck: the higher or lower your Luck, the less the timeout is slowed. The timeout is calculated every turn, meaning gaining or losing a point of Luck could result in that point timing out immediately.

The modified Luck timeout is calculated by the following formula:

    Timeout = 25 * (20 - base_distance) * (20 - base_distance)

base_distance is how far you are from your base luck. If your base luck is 0 and you have 3 Luck, the base_distance is 3. If you have -10 base luck and 10 Luck, the base_distance is 20. The following chart shows how many turns it takes to timeout from one luck level to the next and the total turns to reach the base distance of 0.

| base distance | Timeout | Time to base Luck |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 0             | ∞       | 0                 |
| 1             | 9 025   | 9 025             |

| 17            | 225     | 61 625            |
| 18            | 100     | 61 725            |
| 19            | 25      | 61 750            |
| 20            | 0       | 61 750            |

### Pet behavior
#### Pet Theft
* Pet theft from shops has been totally nerfed.
* Pets will never pick up objects in shops nor eat unpaid food (Gnoll)
* You also cannot #loot items to/from your pet that are unpaid.
* Shopkeepers start with more gold, usually more than double the standard amounts (gnoll)

#### Pets are limited by charisma
* Your maximum number of pets is normally (CHA / 4), but (CHA / 8) on the Astral Plane. If you get more pets than that, they will be untamed starting with the weakest first (Evil)

* Ported from EvilHack with modifications
* The number of pets you can have on a level is now capped at Charisma divided by 4.
* For example, if your charisma is only 7, you can keep 1 pet, at 8 charisma you can keep 2 pets.
* However, if you exceed this limit, your weakest pets (based on level) will be the first to become untamed, with ties resolved randomly.
* Untamed pets that were previously mistreated, such as resurrected ones, may even turn hostile.
* Your steed, while counting toward your pet limit, will never become untamed.
* Summoned spell beings do not count toward the total pet limit.
* On the Astral Plane, the requirement is doubled - so your maximum pets is determined as (CHA / 8).
* Since the minimum CHA possible is 3, you may not be able to have a pet if your charisma is too low.

**Misc pet changes:**
* Steeds are more aggressive - if your steed has a tameness level of 15 or more, it will actively attack monsters instead of merely reacting to being attacked (Evil)
* Chaotics do not get alignment penalties for casting healing at pets (xnh)
* Restrict pets from blowing you up via gas spore, so they won't attack one whilst you are adjacent (xnh)
* Pets never displace player from stairs when entering a level (Dyna).
* Pets' items can be managed with #loot
* We can also see if pets are stunned, confused, or blinded on farlook.
* Pets will use items more intelligently (EvilHack). Many extensions to the pet AI were implemented that help them value armor, weapons, and items so they use the best equipment possible.

### POLYMORPHING OBJECTS
* The number of items you have polymorphed can be viewed in #conduct
* Non-magical potions, scrolls, spellbooks, and wands are much less likely to transform into magical items. These items only have a 1% chance of transforming into something magical. This is now comparable to other non-magical items polymorphing into magical. (dnh)
* The chances of getting a golem from polypiling have been increased (K-Mod)
* The enchantment level or charges can be randomly reduced on polymorphed objects (Spork)

### POLY-SELF
* Players can use gaze attacks in melee range when polymorphed into monsters with a gaze attack.
* Humanoids are more careful about attacking you when you are a dangerous polyform.
* Mind flayers won't purposely to eat the brains of petrifying monsters (ie: when you are polymorphed into a cockatrice)
* When you polymorph into a 'nolimbs' monster, you are able to slip out of a ball & chain (Evil)
* Escape from controlled polymorph prompt no longer causes random poly (from xNetHack).
* Polymorphing into a horned monster destroys flimsy or cloth helms.

### Elbereth and Scare Monster
* Conflict negates Elbereth and scare monster protection (Evil)
* Engraving Elbereth no longer exercises wisdom (from NetHack Fourk).
* You can't dust engrave whilst being held by a monster.
* You can't dust engrave on bloody or grassy tiles.
* Don't waste turns for failed engrave attempts.

**Reverted 82f0b1e8e**
* The previous behavior implmemented in 3.7.0 was "Scared hostile monster which cannot move away will attack."
* This has been reverted so players will be able to stand on scrolls of scare monster or Elbereth without risk of random melee attacks from scared or fleeing monsters.
* The reason for this is that it violates the classic, expected behavior of Elbereth. There are other nerfs to Elbereth and scare-monster that take the place of this.

### NEW GREASE EFFECTS
Many of these changes were introduced to work in conjunction with the new grease trap.
* Greased items can't be disarmed with a bullwhip
* Greased items are harder to steal
* Glib hands makes applying any item except towels drop them
* Towels can be used to remove grease from specific objects (with the risk that they in turn
  become greased)
* Grease can be washed off towels by wetting them
* Greased towels now operate the same way that cursed towels do
* Grease can be washed off your feet/boots by dipping '-' in water, same action as dipping the player's hands.
* Kicking monsters can sometimes get the grease to wear off your boots/feet.
* Greased gloves cause Glib.
* Greased feet/gloves cause fumbling.
* Greased rings slip off your fingers as if you had greasy fingers.

### ENDGAME CHANGES
* Occasional earthquakes can occur during the ascension run (Un/Evil). These will cease after entering the planes.
* After the invocation (and while traversing through Gehennom), monsters will flood from the upstairs (Un/Evil)
* The identity of the Riders hidden via farlook (Un)
* The correct temple on the Astral Plane will not be revealed due to fleeing monsters (Un)
* Replaced undead on Astral Plane with random A (xnh).
* Wizard harassment (after initially killing the Wizard of Yendor) has been increased by 20-25%
* Demonic bribes are much more expensive.
* Level-teleporting (or branchporting) in hell causes major pain. The levelport will still succeed as normal, but costs a large fraction of the hero's HP and energy along with some stunning. It also drains the max of both (up to 1d8 each). To be fair, the player is warned before this happens and can be cancelled. This also includes the Wizard's Tower and Vlad's Tower.
* Amulet of Yendor needs only be carried to hint of nearby portals (Spork).
* Bones file trimming. When bones files are left, there's a high chance of items being polymorphed or shuddering away. This nerfs the common strategy of dumplog peeking.


## AC nerfs & buffs


### Dexterity affects AC
* Ported from EvilHack
* Being encumbered negates AC bonuses from dexterity
* Wearing any kind of heavy metallic body armor (not mithril) or other rigid material also negates beneficial AC bonuses

| Dexterity | AC change |
| --------- | --------- |
| <= 6      | +3        |
| 7-9       | +1        |
| 10-14     | +0        |
| 15-16     | -1        |
| 17-18     | -2        |
| 19-20     | -3        |
| 21-23     | -4        |
| 24-25     | -5        |

### Encumbrance affects AC
* Being encumbered has a severe negative effect on your AC and inflicts +4AC for each level of encumbrance.

| Encumbrance | AC change |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Burdened    | +4        |
| Stressed    | +8        |
| Strained    | +12       |
| Overtaxed   | +16       |
| Overloaded  | +20       |

* **The "wounded legs" status** also inflicts a severe AC penalty for bearing weight. You get +1AC for every 100aum you are carrying whilst you are wounded. Many traps can cause this condition, but now the jungle boots can be useful to prevent it.


## SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE


### SKILL CHANGES
The skill system for achieving proficiency in weapons and spells has been adapted from the UnNetHack system. In UnNetHack most of the requirements for advancing skills have been substantially increased. The major exception is that training skills from unskilled only takes 50 uses compared to UnNetHack's 100.

This chart shows the number of successful uses of a skill required to reach each level.  These values are:

| Skill level  | Successful uses | Old value |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------- |
| Unskilled    | 0               | 0         |
| Basic        | 50              | 20        |
| Skilled      | 200             | 80        |
| Expert       | 400             | 180       |
| Master       | 800             | 320       |
| Grand Master | 1600            | 500       |

* 1-damage hits train weapon/unarmed skills (Dyna)
* Riding skill is exercised more quickly, closer to vanilla (Un)
* Skill gain for spells is faster than skill gain for weapons (Un)
* Training skill in pick-axe affects how fast you can dig (Evil)
    * Skilled gives you the same bonus as a dwarf (x2)
    * Expert gives you double the bonus of a dwarf (x4)

### SHIELD SKILL
* Ported from EvilHack with some modifications
* Shield skill can be trained up like any other weapon attack. It is not actively trained, but passively as you block attacks with your shield. Sometimes you will train even if not directly shielding. There's a 2 in 3 chance of training shield skill whilst wearing one and a regular miss event occurs. A further check is rolled against the enchantment of the shield, with a higher enchantment resulting in more chance of training.
* Different roles can reach different levels of shield skill.
* As a player levels up with shield, there is also a small chance of shield bashing when attacking a monster.

#### Effects at different skill levels:
* Unskilled:  No AC bonus
* Basic:      Grants -1AC, 1 in 25 chance of shield bash
* Skilled:    Grants -3AC, 1 in 17 chance of shield bash
* Expert:     Grants -5AC, 1 in 13 chance of shield bash
* Master:     Grants -8AC, 1 in 10 chance of shield bash

* Knights and valkyries start at basic skill.
* Small shields and antimagic shields deal 1-3 damage
* Tower shields deal 2 - 13 damage
* All other shields deal 2 - 7 damage
* If you are expert or greater in shield skill, you deal an extra d4 damage.

### EXPERIENCE CURVE CHANGES

| 29       | 4 480 000   |
| 30       | 4 800 000   |

### Leveling up bonuses
Players get a to-hit bonus after reaching level 20 (from EvilHack with adjustments)
    * Level 22: +1 to-hit
    * Level 24: +d2 to-hit
    * Level 26: +d3 to-hit, and so on.

Leveling up grants damage bonuses (SlashTHEM)
    * Level 10, +1 damage to attacks.
    * level 20+: +d(x), where x is 1 damage for every additional level gained.
    * For example: At level 25, you would get a combined total of +d6+1 damage (+1 for reaching XP 10 and +6 for levels 20-25).

## Misc changes
* These don't really fit into any category, or are just silly.
* 8d93bedd9 Halu reverse geno troll msg (from UnNetHack).
* 899833966 Funny troll #chat messages (from SpliceHack, I think).

## Quick Reference


**Most important (non-obvious) things to know about NerfHack:**
1. WoWs cannot be recharged. Don't wish for a scroll of recharging!
2. Quest artifacts cannot be wished for
3. Genocide: Unnethack style, blessed = 1 species, uncursed = level
4. Cracked altars are destroyed by gifts/crowning.
5. Many intrinsics can no longer be gained permanently: Invisibility, see invisible, telepathy, teleportitis, teleport control. Intrinsics cannot be gained permanently from eating jewelery.
6. Pets no longer can steal from shops.
7. Crowning requires max luck
8. Your pets are limited by charisma, doubly so on the Astral Plane.
9. Weapons can be safely enchanted up to +11 (if +5 was the old soft limit, +11 is the new soft limit).
10. Unicorn horns only reduce timeout for most things (except illness/vomiting) and their effectiveness depends on it's enchantment and your skill.
11. Rodney cannot steal your quest artifact.
12. Items can completely erode away with enough damage
13. To use a forge, wield a hammer and (a)pply it whilst standing over a forge (no #forge/#craft commands)

Price identification changes:
* Shopkeepers offer 1/2 price for diluted potions.
* Magic markers and magic lamps cost $500
* Magical tools cost more
