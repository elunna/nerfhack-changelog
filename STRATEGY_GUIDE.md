## General strategy guide

* Times are tough and resources are tight - don't default to your standard strategies, use what the dungeon gives you!
* Don't just dilute all potions - potions of healing and see invisible might be more valuable than you think.
* Sokobon is deeper and tougher to get into, however some roles and races might have tricks.
* Use your pets to team up on monsters and get potent flanking bonuses, and avoid getting flanked by foes.
* Most quest nemeses have been buffed or the quests have had extra challenges added, don't go in unprepared.
